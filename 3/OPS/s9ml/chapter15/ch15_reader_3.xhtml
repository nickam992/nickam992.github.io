Chemoreceptors are also in the carotid arteries and in the aorta, where they are primarily sensitive to the pH of the blood. These chemoreceptors are called carotid and aortic bodies. They communicate via sensory nerve fibers with the respiratory center in the medulla oblongata. When the pH drops, they signal this center. Immediately thereafter, the breathing rate increases. Exhaling CO<sub>2</sub> raises the pH of the blood.</p>

Olfactory cells act from a distance, and taste cells act directly. pH receptors also respond to direct stimuli.</p>

Many taste buds lie along the walls of the papillae. These small elevations on the tongue are visible to the naked eye. Isolated taste buds are also present on the hard palate, the pharynx, and the epiglottis. In 2010, researchers at the University of Maryland found chemoreceptors in the human lung that are sensitive only to chemicals that normally taste bitter. These receptors are not clustered in buds, and they do not send taste signals to the brain. Stimulation of these receptors causes the airways to dilate, leading the researchers to speculate about implications for new medications to treat diseases such as asthma.</p>

Foods rich in certain amino acids, such as the common seasoning monosodium glutamate (MSG), as well as certain flavors of cheese, beef broth, and some seafood, produce the taste of umami. Taste buds for each of these tastes are located throughout the tongue, although certain regions may be slightly more sensitive to particular tastes. A food can stimulate more than one of these types of taste buds. The brain appears to survey the overall pattern of incoming sensory impulses and to take a “weighted average” of their taste messages as the perceived taste.</p>

They have supporting cells and a number of elongated taste cells that end in microvilli.

Signals reach the gustatory (taste) cortex, located primarily in the parietal lobe, where they are interpreted as particular tastes.</p>

Nerve fibers from similar olfactory cells lead to the same neuron in the olfactory bulb (an extension of the brain). An odor contains many odor molecules, which activate a characteristic combination of receptor proteins. For example, a rose may stimulate olfactory cells, designated by the blue and green dots in <a href="ch15_reader_3.xhtml#data-uuid-b47c187653db4ea09bfc40f32a6ce904" class="link-inline">Figure 15.5</a>, whereas a dandelion may stimulate a different combination. An odor’s signature in the olfactory bulb is determined by which neurons are stimulated. When the neurons communicate this information via the olfactory tract to the olfactory areas of the cerebral cortex, we know we have smelled either a rose or a carnation.</p>

For example, a smell of a certain food may remind you of a favorite vacation. This is because the olfactory bulbs have direct connections with the limbic system and its centers for emotion and memory (see section 14.3). One investigator showed that when subjects smelled an orange while viewing a painting, they later recalled memories of the painting more vividly and had many deep feelings about the painting.</p>

This can be dangerous if an older person can’t smell smoke or a gas leak. Older people also tend to apply excessive amounts of perfume or cologne before they can detect its smell.</p>
