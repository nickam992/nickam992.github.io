Conjunctivitis is the inflammation of a mucous membrane called the conjunctiva, which covers the eye (except the cornea) and the inner part of the eyelid. The purpose of the conjunctiva is to lubricate the eye and keep it from drying out. In the case of viral conjunctivitis, the most common type, this membrane becomes inflamed as part of an immune response against the viral pathogens. Viral conjunctivitis is highly contagious; individuals with the condition must be careful not to spread the disease. However, not all conjunctivitis is contagious; allergies and other medical conditions can cause pinkeyelike symptoms. Treatment usually involves the use of eyedrops that help lubricate the eye and reduce inflammation.</p>

If glaucoma is not treated, the resulting pressure compresses the arteries that serve the nerve fibers of the retina, where photoreceptors are located. The nerve fibers begin to die because of lack of nutrients, and the person gradually loses his or her vision. Eventually, total blindness can result.</p>

The retina contains photoreceptors called rod cells and cone cells. The rods are very sensitive to light, but they do not detect color. Therefore, at night or in a darkened room, we see only shades of gray. The cones, which require bright light, are sensitive to different wavelengths of light. This sensitivity gives us the ability to distinguish colors. The retina has a very special region called the <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-fovea-centralis"><dfn title="fovea centralis">fovea centralis</dfn></a> where cone cells are densely packed. Light is normally focused on the fovea when we look directly at an object. This is helpful because the sharpest images are produced by the fovea centralis.

During visual accommodation, the lens changes its shape to bring the image into focus on the retina. The shape of the lens is controlled by the ciliary muscle, within the ciliary body. When we view a distant object, the ciliary muscle is relaxed, causing the suspensory ligaments attached to the ciliary body to be taut. The ligaments put tension on the lens and cause it to remain relatively flat (<a href="ch15_reader_4.xhtml#data-uuid-778115116a9148748b894c1470712649" class="link-inline">Fig. 15.7<i>a</i></a>). When we view a near object, the ciliary muscle contracts, releasing the tension on the suspensory ligaments. The lens becomes round and thick due to its natural elasticity (<a href="ch15_reader_4.xhtml#data-uuid-778115116a9148748b894c1470712649" class="link-inline">Fig. 15.7<i>b</i></a>). Thus, contraction or relaxation of the ciliary muscle allows the image to be focused on the retina. Close work requires contraction of the ciliary muscle, so it often causes muscle fatigue, known as eyestrain. Eyestrain is more common after the age of 40, because the lens loses some of its elasticity and is unable to accommodate. It is also common among those who work with computers, because the intense focusing causes the person to blink less, allowing the eyes to dry out. Eyedrops and/or corrective lenses, either eyeglasses or contact lenses, may be necessary to reduce eyestrain.</p>

Rods are very sensitive to light and, therefore, are suited to night vision.

Rod cells are plentiful throughout the retina, except the fovea. Therefore, rods also provide us with peripheral vision and perception of motion.</p>

Each pigment is made up of retinal and opsin, but there is a slight difference in the opsin structure of each. This accounts for their individual absorption patterns. Various combinations of cones are believed to be stimulated by in-between shades of color.</p>

No wonder the stimulation of rods results in vision that is blurred and indistinct. In contrast, some cone cells in the fovea centralis activate only one ganglion cell.

Normally, the lens is clear, allowing light to pass through easily. A cloudy lens allows less light to reach the retina and slowly causes vision loss. Fortunately, a doctor can surgically remove the cloudy lens and replace it with a clear plastic lens, which often restores the light level passing through the lens and improves the patient’s vision.</p>
            <p id="data-uuid-99278bae4e9b424fa796bc5ae373e769" data-uuid="99278bae4e9b424fa796bc5ae373e769">Glaucoma is caused by a buildup of fluid pressure inside the eye and may lead to a decrease in vision. The condition may eventually cause blindness. Eyedrops and oral medications are often prescribed to help reduce the interior pressure. If eyedrops and medications are not capable of controlling the pressure, surgery may be the only option. During glaucoma surgery, the doctor uses a laser to create tiny holes in the eye where the cornea and iris meet. This increases fluid drainage from the eye and decreases the pressure inside the eye.</p>

Difficulties in reading small print, or reading in low-light conditions, is usually the first sign of presbyopia. The condition usually begins in the late thirties and is common by age 55. Reading in low-light situations becomes more difficult, and letters begin to look fuzzy when reading close-up. Many people who suffer from presbyopia experience headaches while reading. Although historically people accommodated for the condition by using a magnifying lens, today most people wear bifocal lenses. Bifocals are designed to correct vision at a distance of 12 to 18 inches. These lenses work well for most people while reading but pose a problem for those who use a computer. Computer monitors are usually 19 to 24 inches away. This forces bifocal lens wearers to constantly move their head up and down in an attempt to switch between the close and distant viewing sections of the bifocals. Another solution is to wear contact lenses with one eye corrected to see close objects and the other eye corrected to see distant objects. The same type of correction can be done with LASIK surgery (<a href="ch15_reader_4.xhtml#data-uuid-92a8e867f5744babb45c1fe7b2748193" class="link-inline">Fig. 15A</a>). LASIK, which stands for <i>laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis,</i> is generally a safe and effective treatment option for a wide array of vision problems.</p>

For the majority of patients, LASIK improves their vision and reduces their dependency on corrective lenses. The ideal LASIK candidate is over 18 years of age and has had a stable contact or glasses prescription for at least 2 years. Patients need to have a cornea thick enough to allow the surgeon to safely create a clean corneal flap of appropriate depth. Typically, patients affected by common vision problems (nearsightedness, astigmatism, or farsightedness) respond well to LASIK. Anyone who suffers from any disease that decreases his or her ability to heal properly after surgery is not a candidate for LASIK. Candidates should thoroughly discuss the procedure with their eye-care professional before electing to have LASIK. People need to realize that the goal of LASIK is to reduce their dependency on glasses or contact lenses, not to eliminate them completely.</p>
            <p id="data-uuid-cc41db2c4c10423ba7282b0f0947f274" data-uuid="cc41db2c4c10423ba7282b0f0947f274">Individuals who suffer from cataracts, advanced glaucoma, or corneal or other eye diseases are not considered for LASIK. Patients who expect LASIK to completely correct their visual problems and make them totally independent of their corrective lenses are not good candidates, either.</p>

The flap is folded back, exposing the cornea, allowing the surgeon to remove a defined amount of tissue from the cornea. Each pulse of the laser removes a small amount of corneal tissue, allowing the surgeon to flatten or increase the steepness of the curve of the cornea. After the procedure, the flap of tissue is put back into place and allowed to heal on its own. LASIK patients receive eyedrops or medications to help relieve the discomfort associated with the procedure. Improvements to vision begin as early as the day after the surgery but typically take 2 to 3 months. Most patients will have vision close to 20/20, but the chances for improved vision are based in part on how good the person’s eyes were before the surgery.</p>

Adverse effects include a sensation of having something in the eye or having blurred vision. The individual might also see halos around objects or be very sensitive to glare. In addition, dryness can cause eye irritation. Typically, these effects are temporary, and the rate of complications following surgery is very low. Always consult with your doctor before considering any type of surgery.</p>
