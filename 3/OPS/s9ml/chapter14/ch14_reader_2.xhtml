As mentioned previously, both the spinal cord and the brain are protected by bone. The spinal cord is surrounded by vertebrae, and the brain is enclosed by the skull. Also, both the spinal cord and the brain are wrapped in protective membranes known as <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-meninges"><dfn title="meninges">meninges</dfn></a><b>.</b> <i>Meningitis</i> is an infection of the meninges and may be caused by either bacterial or viral pathogens. The spaces between the meninges are filled with <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-cerebrospinal-fluid"><dfn title="cerebrospinal fluid">cerebrospinal fluid</dfn></a><b>,</b> which cushions and protects the CNS. In a spinal tap (lumbar puncture), a small amount of this fluid is withdrawn from around the spinal cord for laboratory testing. Cerebrospinal fluid is also contained within the ventricles of the brain and in the central canal of the spinal cord. The brain has four <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-ventricle"><dfn title="ventricle">ventricles</dfn></a><b>,</b> interconnecting chambers that produce and serve as a reservoir for cerebrospinal fluid (<a href="ch14_reader_2.xhtml#data-uuid-b5f4c148a3e141f99241bfcc98cfc845" class="link-inline">Fig. 14.6</a>). Normally, any excess cerebrospinal fluid drains away into the cardiovascular system. However, blockages can occur. In an infant, the brain can enlarge due to cerebrospinal fluid accumulation, resulting in a condition called hydrocephalus (“water on the brain”). If cerebrospinal fluid collects in an adult, the brain cannot enlarge. Instead, it is pushed against the skull. Such situations cause severe brain damage and can be fatal unless quickly corrected.</p>

The gray matter is centrally located and shaped like the letter H (<a href="ch14_reader_2.xhtml#data-uuid-23a549b46d264cefbf697c932e505523" class="link-inline">Fig. 14.7<i>a–</i><i>c</i></a>). Portions of sensory neurons and motor neurons are found in gray matter, as are interneurons that communicate with these two types of neurons. The dorsal root of a spinal nerve contains sensory fibers entering the gray matter. The ventral root of a spinal nerve contains motor fibers exiting the gray matter. The dorsal and ventral roots join before the spinal nerve leaves the vertebral canal (<a href="ch14_reader_2.xhtml#data-uuid-23a549b46d264cefbf697c932e505523" class="link-inline">Fig. 14.7<i>c</i>, <i>d</i></a>), forming a mixed nerve.

The white matter contains ascending tracts taking information to the brain (primarily located posteriorly) and descending tracts taking information from the brain (primarily located anteriorly). Many tracts cross just after they enter and exit the brain, so the left side of the brain controls the right side of the body. Likewise, the right side of the brain controls the left side of the body.</p>

When someone touches your hand, sensory receptors generate nerve signals that pass through sensory fibers to the spinal cord and up ascending tracts to the brain (see <a href="ch14_reader_1.xhtml#data-uuid-7ba3fa3c2de847cbaf6f2d20d4b8db88" class="link-inline">Fig. 14.1<i>b</i></a>, red arrows).</p>

Depending on how the gates process a pain signal, the pain message can be allowed to pass directly to the brain or can be prevented from reaching the brain. As mentioned earlier, endorphins can temporarily block pain messages. Pain messages may also be blocked by other inputs, such as those received from touch receptors.</p>
        <p id="data-uuid-1a58769dc00c4db092355499740768c8" data-uuid="1a58769dc00c4db092355499740768c8">The brain coordinates the voluntary control of our limbs. Motor signals originating in the brain pass down descending tracts to the spinal cord and out to our muscles by way of motor fibers (see <a href="ch14_reader_1.xhtml#data-uuid-7ba3fa3c2de847cbaf6f2d20d4b8db88" class="link-inline">Fig. 14.1<i>b</i></a>, black arrows). Therefore, if the spinal cord is severed, we suffer a loss of sensation and a loss of voluntary control—paralysis. If the cut occurs in the thoracic region, the lower body and legs are paralyzed, a condition known as <i>paraplegia.</i> If the injury is in the neck region, all four limbs are usually affected, a condition called <i>quadriplegia.</i></p>

A stimulus causes sensory receptors to generate signals that travel in sensory axons to the spinal cord. Interneurons integrate the incoming data and relay signals to motor neurons. A response to the stimulus occurs when motor axons cause skeletal muscles to contract. Motor neurons in a reflex arc may also affect smooth muscle, organs, or glands. Each interneuron in the spinal cord synapses with numerous other neurons. From there, interneurons send signals to other interneurons and motor neurons.</p>

For example, when blood pressure falls, internal receptors in the carotid arteries and aorta generate nerve signals that pass through sensory fibers to the cord and then up an ascending tract to a cardiovascular center in the brain. Thereafter, nerve signals pass down a descending tract to the spinal cord. Motor signals then cause blood vessels to constrict, so that the blood pressure rises.</p>

            Much of the rest of the cerebrum is composed of white matter. Myelination occurs and white matter develops as a child grows. Progressive myelination enables the brain to grow in size and complexity. For example, as neurons become myelinated within tracts designed for language development, children become more capable of speech. Descending tracts from the primary motor area communicate with lower brain centers, and ascending tracts from lower brain centers send sensory information up to the primary somatosensory area. Tracts within the cerebrum also take information among the different sensory, motor, and association areas pictured in <a href="ch14_reader_2.xhtml#data-uuid-52b6302e57d14fad98b811e6a0431824" class="link-inline">Figure 14.9</a>.

The RAS can filter out unnecessary sensory stimuli, explaining why you can study with the TV on. Similarly, the RAS allows you to take a test without noticing the sounds of the people around you—unless the sounds are particularly distracting. To inactivate the RAS, remove visual or auditory stimuli, allowing yourself to become drowsy and drop off to sleep. General anesthetics function by artificially suppressing the RAS. A severe injury to the RAS can cause a person to become comatose, from which recovery may be impossible.</p>
