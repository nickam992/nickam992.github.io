The limbic system blends primitive emotions and higher mental functions into a united whole. As already noted, it accounts for why activities such as sexual behavior and eating seem pleasurable. Conversely, unpleasant sensations or emotions (pain, frustration, hatred, despair) are translated by the limbic system into a stress response.</p>

<p id="data-uuid-f62d7db5cdde4af4a8ddaced37148cc4" data-uuid="f62d7db5cdde4af4a8ddaced37148cc4">Two significant structures in the limbic system are the amygdala and the hippocampus. The <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-amygdala"><dfn title="amygdala">amygdala</dfn></a><b>,</b> in particular, can cause experiences to have emotional overtones, and it creates the sensation of fear. This center can use past knowledge fed to it by association areas to assess a current situation. If necessary, the amygdala can trigger the fight-or-flight reaction. So if you are out late at night and you turn to see someone in a ski mask following you, the amygdala may immediately cause you to start running. The frontal cortex can override the limbic system, cause you to rethink the situation, and prevent you from acting out strong reactions.</p>

The hippocampal region acts as an information gateway during the learning process. It determines what information about the world is to be sent to memory and how this information is to be encoded and stored by other regions in the brain. Most likely, the hippocampus can communicate with the frontal cortex, because we know that memories are an important part of our decision-making processes.</p>

If we say we are trying to keep it in the forefront of our brain, we are exactly correct. The prefrontal area, active during <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-short-term-memory"><dfn title="short-term memory">short-term memory</dfn></a><b>,</b> lies just posterior to our forehead! There are some telephone numbers that we have memorized. In other words, they have gone into <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-long-term-memory"><dfn title="long-term memory">long-term memory</dfn></a><b>.</b> Think of a telephone number you know by heart, and try to bring it to mind without also thinking about the place or person associated with that number. Most likely you cannot. Typically, long-term memory is a mixture of what is called <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-semantic-memory"><dfn title="semantic memory">semantic memory</dfn></a> (numbers, words, etc.) and <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-episodic-memory"><dfn title="episodic memory">episodic memory</dfn></a> (persons, events, etc.).</p>

Skill memory is involved in performing motor activities such as riding a bike or playing ice hockey. When a person first learns a skill, more areas of the cerebral cortex are involved than after the skill is perfected. In other words, you have to think about what you are doing when you learn a skill, but later the actions become automatic. Skill memory involves all the motor areas of the cerebrum below the level of consciousness.</p>

Visions are stored in the vision association area, sounds are stored in the auditory association area, and so forth. As previously mentioned, the hippocampus serves as a bridge between the sensory association areas (where memories are stored) and the prefrontal area (where memories are used). The prefrontal area communicates with the hippocampus when memories are stored and when these memories are brought to mind. Some memories are emotionally charged, because the amygdala seems to be responsible for fear conditioning and associating danger with sensory stimuli received from various parts of the brain.</p>

After synapses have been used intensively for a short time, they release more neurotransmitters than before. This phenomenon, called <i>long-term potentiation,</i> may be involved in memory storage.</p>

In anterograde amnesia, injury to the limbic system separates long-term memories of events that occurred prior to the injury from events that occur in the here and now. An affected person might carry on a conversation about past events (memories of a long-ago birthday) but cannot recall a breakfast menu from that morning. In retrograde amnesia, a blow to the head or similar injury abolishes all memories for a variable time before the injury. For example, a head injury occurring during a car accident may abolish all memories from hours to days prior to the accident.</p>

Damage to Wernickeâs area, discussed earlier, results in the inability to comprehend speech. Damage to Brocaâs area, on the other hand, results in the inability to speak and write. The functions of the visual cortex, Wernickeâs area, and Brocaâs area are shown in <a href="ch14_reader_3.xhtml#data-uuid-0483e9b5d1594926bfa02fe3db7f2607" class="link-inline">Figure 14.13</a>.</p>

A radioactively labeled solution is injected into the subject, and then the subject is asked to perform certain activities. Cross-sectional images of the brain generated by the computer reveal where activity is occurring because the solution is preferentially taken up by active brain tissue and not by inactive brain tissue.

Recall that the left hemisphere contains both Brocaâs area and Wernickeâs area. As you might expect, it appears that the left hemisphere plays a role of great importance in language functions. The role of the isolated left hemisphere can be studied in patients after surgery to sever the corpus callosum. This procedure is used for seizure control in patients with epilepsy. After surgery, the patient is termed âsplit brain,â because there is no longer direct communication between the two cerebral hemispheres. If a split-brain individual views an object with only the right eye, its image will be sent only to the right hemisphere. This person will be able to choose the proper object for a particular useâscissors to cut paper, for exampleâbut will be unable to name that object.</p>
