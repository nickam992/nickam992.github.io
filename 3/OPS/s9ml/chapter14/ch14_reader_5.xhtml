Neurotransmitters at these synapses control the firing of countless action potentials, thus creating a network of neural circuits. It is amazing to realize that all thoughts, feelings, and actions of a human are dependent on neurotransmitters in the CNS and PNS. By modifying or controlling synaptic transmission, a wide variety of drugs with neurological activity, both legal pharmaceuticals and illegal drugs of abuse, can alter mood, emotional state, behavior, and personality.</p>

The most widely studied neurotransmitters to date are acetylcholine, norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). <i>Acetylcholine</i> is an essential CNS neurotransmitter for memory circuits in the limbic system. <i>Norepinephrine </i>is important to dreaming, waking, and mood. The neurotransmitter <i>dopamine</i> plays a central role in the brain’s regulation of mood. Dopamine is also the basal nuclei neurotransmitter that helps organize coordinated movements. <i>Serotonin</i> is involved in thermoregulation, sleeping, emotions, and perception. <i>GABA</i> is an abundant inhibitory neurotransmitter in the CNS.</p>
        <p id="data-uuid-71660a4d6de54411b5d67dcf741389af" data-uuid="71660a4d6de54411b5d67dcf741389af">Neuromodulators are naturally occurring molecules that block the release of a neurotransmitter or modify a neuron’s response to a neurotransmitter. Two well-known neuromodulators are <i>substance P</i> and <i>endorphins.</i> Substance P is a neuropeptide that is released by sensory neurons when pain is present. Endorphins block the release of substance P and serve as natural painkillers. Endorphins are produced by the brain during times of physical and/or emotional stress. They are associated with the “runner’s high” of joggers.</p>
        <p id="data-uuid-faf54a7664c546d0b627aee6f79eaaef" data-uuid="faf54a7664c546d0b627aee6f79eaaef">Both pharmaceuticals and illegal drugs have several basic modes of action:</p>

Examples include drugs such as alprazolam (Xanax) and diazepam (Valium), which increase GABA. These medications are used for panic attacks and anxiety. Reduced levels of norepinephrine and serotonin are linked to depression. Drugs such as fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), and duloxetine (Cymbalta) allow norepinephrine and/or serotonin to accumulate at the synapse, which explains their effectiveness as anti-depressants. Alzheimer disease causes a slow, progressive loss of memory (see <a href="../chapter18/ch18_reader_0.xhtml" class="link-inline">Chapter 18</a>). Drugs used for Alzheimer disease allow acetylcholine to accumulate at synapses in the limbic system.</p>

For instance, antipsychotic drugs used for the treatment of schizophrenia decrease the activity of dopamine. The caffeine in coffee, chocolate, and tea keeps us awake by interfering with the effects of inhibitory neurotransmitters in the brain.

These studies will undoubtedly improve treatments for mental illness, as well as provide insight into the problem of drug abuse.</p>

As mentioned previously, the neurotransmitter dopamine is essential for mood regulation. Dopamine plays a central role in the working of the brain’s built-in <i>reward circuit.</i> The reward circuit is a collection of neurons that, under normal circumstances, promotes healthy, pleasurable activities, such as consuming food. It’s possible to abuse behaviors such as eating, spending, or gambling because the behaviors stimulate the reward circuit and make us feel good. Drug abusers take drugs that artificially affect the reward circuit to the point that they neglect their basic physical needs in favor of continued drug use.</p>

Drug abusers are apt to display a psychological and/or physical dependence on the drug. Psychological dependence is apparent when a person craves the drug, spends time seeking the drug, and takes it regularly. With physical dependence, formerly called “addiction,” the person has become tolerant to the drug. More is needed to get the same effect, and withdrawal symptoms occur when he or she stops taking the drug. This is true for not only teenagers and adults but also newborn babies of mothers who abuse and are addicted to drugs. Alcohol, drugs, and tobacco can all adversely affect the developing embryo, fetus, or newborn.</p>

According to a 2006 survey, nearly one-third of all U.S. high school students reported hazardous drinking (five or more drinks in one setting) during the 30 days preceding the survey. Notably, 80% of college-age young adults drink. According to a U.S. government study, drinking in college contributes to an estimated 1,400 student deaths, 500,000 injuries, and 70,000 cases of sexual assault or date rape each year.</p>

Depending on the amount consumed, the effects of alcohol on the brain can lead to a feeling of relaxation, lowered inhibitions, impaired concentration and coordination, slurred speech, and vomiting. If the blood level of alcohol becomes too high, coma or death can occur.</p>

With names like Four Loko, JOOSE, and Sparks, these drinks combine fairly high levels of alcohol with caffeine and other ingredients. Although interactions between drugs can be complex, the stimulant effects of caffeine can counteract some of the depressant effects of alcohol, so users feel able to drink more. Because caffeine does not reduce the intoxicating effects of alcohol, many state legislatures are banning these products, and in November 2010, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration warned several manufacturers that they would no longer be allowed to mix caffeine with alcohol in their products.</p>

Young adults between age 18 and 25 reported the highest tobacco usage of any age group, at 45%. When tobacco is smoked or chewed, nicotine is rapidly delivered throughout the body. It causes a release of epinephrine from the adrenal glands, increasing blood sugar and causing the initial feeling of stimulation. As blood sugar falls, depression and fatigue set in, causing the user to seek more nicotine. In the CNS, nicotine stimulates neurons to release dopamine, a neurotransmitter that promotes a temporary sense of pleasure, and reinforces dependence on the drug. About 70% of people who try smoking become addicted.</p>

Once addicted, however, only 10–20% of smokers are able to quit. Most medical approaches to quitting smoking involve the administration of nicotine in safer forms, such as skin patches, gum, or a newly developed nicotine inhaler, so that withdrawal symptoms can be minimized while dependence is gradually reduced. As of 2010, an antinicotine vaccine called NicVAX was showing promise in early clinical trials. The vaccine stimulates the production of antibodies that prevent nicotine from entering the brain.</p>

Approximately 35 million Americans have used cocaine by sniffing/snorting, injecting, or smoking. Cocaine is a powerful stimulant in the CNS that interferes with the reuptake of dopamine at synapses, increasing overall brain activity. The result is a rush of well-being that lasts from 5 to 30 minutes. However, long-term use of cocaine causes a loss of metabolic functions in the brain (<a href="ch14_reader_5.xhtml#data-uuid-fe2797fdc85d46cdbef11e97c4a28de2" class="link-inline">Fig. 14.18</a>).</p>

The term <i>crack</i> refers to the crackling sound heard when the drug is smoked. Smoking allows high doses of the drug to reach the brain rapidly, providing an intense and immediate high, or “rush.” Approximately 8 million Americans use crack.</p>
        <p id="data-uuid-52450e1e5fa9427d8eed322b70c971b5" data-uuid="52450e1e5fa9427d8eed322b70c971b5">A cocaine binge is a period in which a user takes the drug at ever-higher doses. The user is hyperactive, with little desire for food or sleep but an increased sex drive. This is followed by a crash period, characterized by fatigue, depression, irritability, and lack of interest in sex. In fact, men who use cocaine often become impotent.</p>
        <p id="data-uuid-7d07a54c11c246e79d013a12df70fe7b" data-uuid="7d07a54c11c246e79d013a12df70fe7b">Cocaine is highly addictive; with continued use, the brain makes less dopamine to compensate for a seemingly endless supply. The user experiences withdrawal symptoms and an intense craving for cocaine. Overdosing on cocaine can cause cardiac and/or respiratory arrest.</p>

Methamphetamine (commonly called meth or crank) is a powerful CNS stimulant. Meth is often produced in makeshift home laboratories, usually starting with ephedrine or pseudoephedrine, common ingredients in many cold and asthma medicines. As a result, many states have passed laws making these medications more difficult to purchase. The number of toxic chemicals used to prepare the drug makes a former meth lab site hazardous to humans and to the environment. Over 9 million people in the United States have used methamphetamine at least once in their lifetime. It is available as a powder that can be snorted or as crystals (crystal meth or ice) that can be smoked.</p>
        <p id="data-uuid-6c774e6418694f3dbab7b3df14470c54" data-uuid="6c774e6418694f3dbab7b3df14470c54">The structure of methamphetamine is similar to that of dopamine, and the most immediate effect of taking meth is a rush of euphoria, energy, alertness, and elevated mood. However, this is typically followed by a state of agitation that, in some individuals, leads to violent behavior. Chronic use can result in what is called an amphetamine psychosis, characterized by paranoia, hallucinations, irritability, and aggressive, erratic behavior.</p>
        <p id="data-uuid-16792de0abc648e18d4ce581dd76a5d2" data-uuid="16792de0abc648e18d4ce581dd76a5d2">Ecstasy is the street name for MDMA (methylenedioxymethamphetamine), which is chemically similar to methamphetamine. Many users say that “X,” taken as a pill that looks like an aspirin or candy, increases their feelings of well-being and love for other people. However, it has many of the same side effects as other stimulants, plus it can interfere with temperature regulation, leading to hyperthermia, high blood pressure, and seizures. Although deaths from alcohol abuse are more common, ecstasy is identified as a cause of accidental death in young adults each year.</p>
        <p id="data-uuid-9eef49ad9faf44369eadc3f7bdfcd1ff" data-uuid="9eef49ad9faf44369eadc3f7bdfcd1ff">Drugs with sedative effects, known as date rape or predatory drugs, include flunitrazepam (Rohypnol, or roofies), gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB), and ketamine (special K). Ketamine is actually a drug that veterinarians sometimes use to perform surgery on animals. Any of these drugs can be given to an unsuspecting person, who may fall into a dreamlike state in which they are unable to move, and thus are vulnerable to sexual assault.</p>

Drugs derived from opium are called opiates, a class that also includes morphine and codeine. After heroin is injected, snorted, or smoked, a feeling of euphoria, along with relief of any pain, occurs within a few minutes. It is estimated that 4 million Americans have used heroin sometime in their lives, and over 300,000 people use heroin annually.</p>
        <p id="data-uuid-92bfba7d1cb84f8cbd1c62048e60e167" data-uuid="92bfba7d1cb84f8cbd1c62048e60e167">As with other drugs of abuse, addiction is common. Heroin binds to receptors meant for the endorphins, naturally occurring neurotransmitters that kill pain and produce feelings of tranquility. With repeated heroin use, the body’s production of endorphins decreases. Tolerance develops, so the user needs to take more of the drug just to prevent withdrawal symptoms (tremors, restlessness, cramps, vomiting), and the original euphoria is no longer felt. Long-term users commonly acquire hepatitis, HIV/AIDS, and various bacterial infections due to the use of shared needles, and heavy users may experience convulsions and death by respiratory arrest.</p>

However, methadone itself can be addictive, and methadone-related deaths are on the rise.</p>

The names cannabis and marijuana apply to either the plant or THC. Marijuana can be ingested, but usually it is smoked in a cigarette called a “joint.” Although the drug was banned in the United States in 1937, an estimated 22 million Americans use marijuana, making it the most commonly used illegal drug in the United States. Beginning with California in 1996, several states have legalized its use for medical purposes, such as treating cancer, AIDS, and glaucoma. In 2013, Colorado legalized recreational use, and several states are considering similar legislation. However, in 2005, the Supreme Court ruled that patients prescribed medical marijuana can still be prosecuted by federal agencies.</p>

The occasional marijuana user experiences mild euphoria, along with alterations in vision and judgment. Heavy use can cause hallucinations, anxiety, depression, paranoia, and psychotic symptoms. Research is under way to identify the effects of long-term marijuana use on the brain, as well as on the effects of secondhand smoke on the respiratory system.</p>

Originally synthesized by an organic chemist at Clemson University, K2 is about ten times as potent as THC. The chemical is typically sprayed onto a mixture of other herbal products and smoked. However, because there is no regulation of how it is produced, the amount of K2 itself, or contaminants, can vary greatly. This may account for the several reports of serious medical problems and even deaths among K2 users.</p>

Many individuals with MS are able to control their symptoms by using immunosuppressive medications, such as beta interferons. The fact that this treatment works suggests that in many cases MS is caused by the immune system incorrectly identifying the myelin sheaths as foreign material. The breakdown of the myelin can be detected using both MRI and SSEP tests (presented in the case study introduction). However, environmental conditions are also suspected to cause MS. Studies have shown that the risk of contracting MS is influenced in part by where in the world you live, although the specific environmental factor or pollutant has not yet been identified. Genetics is also believed to play a role in some cases. However, most researchers believe that a defect in a single gene is unlikely. Rather, it is more likely that a certain combination of genetic factors places an individual at a higher risk of contracting MS. Though there is no cure for MS, researchers have been very successful in developing disease-modifying drugs that reduce the symptoms and allow the individual to lead a normal life.</p>
