The ability of a cell or an organism to maintain an internal environment that operates under specific conditions is called <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-homeostasis"><dfn title="homeostasis">homeostasis</dfn></a><b>.</b> In humans, many of our organ systems work to maintain homeostasis. For example, human body temperature normally fluctuates slightly between 36.5 and 37.5°C (97.7 and 99.5°F) during the day. In general, the lowest temperature usually occurs between 2 <small>a.m</small>. and 4 <small>a.m</small>., and the highest usually occurs between 6 <small>p.m</small>. and 10 <small>p.m</small>. However, activity can cause the body temperature to rise, and inactivity can cause it to decline. A number of body systems, including the cardiovascular system and the nervous system, work together to maintain a constant temperature. However, the body’s ability to maintain a normal temperature is somewhat dependent on the external temperature. Even though we can shiver when we are cold and perspire when we are hot, we will die if the external temperature becomes overly cold or hot.</p>
        <p id="data-uuid-41fd122cec7d4eef87565685d23b5a42" data-uuid="41fd122cec7d4eef87565685d23b5a42">This text emphasizes how all the systems of the human body help maintain homeostasis. For example, the digestive system takes in nutrients, and the respiratory system exchanges gases with the environment. The cardiovascular system distributes nutrients and oxygen to the cells and picks up their wastes. The metabolic waste products of cells are excreted by the urinary system. The work of the nervous and endocrine systems is critical, because these systems coordinate the functions of the other systems. Throughout the text, the Connecting the Concepts sections will provide you with links to more information on homeostasis.</p>

Response to external stimuli is more apparent to us, because it involves movement, as when we quickly remove a hand from a hot stove. Certain sensory receptors also detect a change in the internal environment, and then the central nervous system brings about an appropriate response. When you are startled by a loud noise, your heartbeat increases, which causes your blood pressure to increase. If blood pressure rises too high, the brain directs blood vessels to dilate, helping restore normal blood pressure.</p>

Organisms may use a variety of mechanisms to move, but movement in humans and other animals is dependent on their nervous and musculoskeletal systems. The leaves of plants track the passage of the sun during the day; when a houseplant is placed near a window, its stems bend to face the sun. The movement of an animal, whether self-directed or in response to a stimulus, constitutes a large part of its behavior. Some behaviors help us acquire food and reproduce.</p>

When a new variation arises that allows certain members of a population to capture more resources, these members tend to survive and have more offspring than the other, unchanged members. Therefore, each successive generation will include more members with the new variation, which represents an <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-adaptation"><dfn title="adaptation">adaptation</dfn></a> to the environment. Consider, for example, populations of humans that live at high altitudes, such as the cultures living at elevations of over 4,000 meters (m) (14,000 ft) in the Tibetan Plateau. This environment is very low in oxygen. As the Science feature, “Adapting to Life at High Elevations,” investigates, these populations have evolved an adaptation that actually reduces the amount of hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying pigment in the blood. As the feature explains, this adaptation makes life at these altitudes possible. </p>

All organisms share the same characteristics of life because their ancestry can be traced to the first cell or cells. Organisms are diverse because they are adapted to different ways of life.</p>

This means not only that we share common ancestors with other animals but also that over time we demonstrate adaptations to changing environmental conditions. One study of populations living in the high-elevation mountains of Tibet (<a href="ch01_reader_1.xhtml#data-uuid-605f3f6e300448088f4432dae0c952b2" class="link-inline">Fig. 1A</a>) demonstrates how the processes of evolution and adaptation influence humans.</p>

For minor elevation changes, this does not present much of a problem. But for people who live at extreme elevations (some people in the Himalayas can live at elevations of over 13,000 ft, or close to 4,000 m), this can present a number of health problems, including chronic mountain sickness, a disease that affects people who live at high altitudes for extended periods of time. The problem is that, as the amount of hemoglobin increases, the blood thickens and becomes more viscous. This can cause elevated blood pressure, or hypertension, and an increase in the formation of blood clots, both of which have negative physiological effects.</p>
            <p id="data-uuid-3ec83cffcc2b4779a31c75c38c348959" data-uuid="3ec83cffcc2b4779a31c75c38c348959">Because high hemoglobin levels would be a detriment to people at high elevations, it makes sense that natural selection would favor individuals who produced less hemoglobin at high elevations. Such is the case with the Tibetans in this study. Researchers have identified an allele of a gene that reduces hemoglobin production at high elevations. Comparisons between Tibetans at both high and low elevations strongly suggest that selection has played a role in the prevalence of the high-elevation allele.</p>
            <p id="data-uuid-3ae08eddad344c19a772bc1a66fa10fc" data-uuid="3ae08eddad344c19a772bc1a66fa10fc">The gene is <i>EPSA1,</i> located on chromosome 2 of humans. <i>EPSA1</i> produces a transcription factor, which basically regulates which genes are turned on and off in the body, a process called gene expression. The transcription factor produced by <i>EPSA1</i> has a number of functions in the body. For example, in addition to controlling the amount of hemoglobin in the blood, this transcription factor also regulates other genes that direct how the body uses oxygen.</p>

Therefore, the Tibetan population has lower hemoglobin levels than people living at lower altitudes, allowing these individuals to escape the consequences of thick blood.</p>

Modern genetic analysis allows scientists to model the rate of evolutionary change. By comparing these genes in high-elevation and low-elevation Tibetan populations, the researchers were able to determine that the process probably occurred over less than 3,000 years. If we use a 25-year generation time for humans, that means that the adaptation to the high-elevation environment probably took less than 120 generations for this Tibetan population.</p>
