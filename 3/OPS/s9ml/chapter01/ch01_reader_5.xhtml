Science is a slightly different endeavor than technology. <b><a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-technology"><dfn title="technology">Technology</dfn></a> </b>is the application of scientific knowledge to the interests of humans. Scientific investigations are the basis for the majority of our technological advances.

In this section, we are going to explore some of the challenges facing science, technology, and society.<span> </span><br />

The inclusion of a review process means that science has a built-in safety mechanism. Still, the process is not perfect. A technology may be developed for one purpose, then adapted in a way not anticipated by the initial researcher. <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-Bioethics"><dfn title="Bioethics">Bioethics</dfn></a> is the branch of ethics concerned with the development and consequences of biological technology.<span> </span><span><br />

Investigations into cell structure and genes led to the current biotechnology revolution. We now know how to manipulate genes. If you have diabetes and are using insulin, it was produced by genetically modified (GM) bacteria. Despite its benefits, there are risks associated with biotechnology. Ecologists are concerned that GM crops could endanger the biosphere. For example, many farmers are now planting GM cotton that produces an insect-killing toxin. Though insect pests are their intended target, toxins may also kill the natural predators that feed on insect pests. It may not be wise to kill off friendly predatory insects. People are now eating GM foods and/or foods that have been manufactured by using GM products. Some people are concerned about the possible effects of GM foods on human health.<span><br />

Humans clear forests or grasslands in order to grow crops; later, they build houses on what was once farmland; finally, they convert small towns into cities. As coasts are developed, humans send sediments, sewage, and other pollutants into the sea. In the process, they disrupt the normal flow of energy and nutrients in the ecosystem. Tropical rain forests, coral reefs, and most of the other ecosystems are severely threatened as the human population increases in size. Some coral reefs are 50 million years old, yet in just a few decades human activities have destroyed 10% of all reefs and seriously degraded another 30%. At this rate, nearly three-quarters could be destroyed within 50 years. Similar statistics are available for tropical rain forests.</p>

The present number of species has been estimated to be as high as 15 million, but so far around 2 million have been identified, named, and classified. The biodiversity that surrounds us is the result of approximately 3.5 billion years of evolution. Unfortunately, technology-enabled human activities present a major threat to biodiversity. When we talk about the loss of biodiversity, we often also mention extinction. <b><a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-extinction"><dfn title="extinction">Extinction</dfn></a> </b>is the death of a species or a larger taxonomic group. Although it is natural for species extinctions to occur over time, human activities have increased the extinction rate by a factor of 100 to 1,000. It is estimated that hundreds of species are being lost every year because of human activities. Many biologists are alarmed about the present rate of extinction and the resulting loss of biodiversity worldwide.<br />

We depend on other living organisms to supply us with food, clothing, medicines, and construction materials (<a href="ch01_reader_5.xhtml#data-uuid-8c53f83b1ba2474aa61b8d178ed30ea6" class="link-inline">Fig. 1.11</a>). We need other species to help clean up our pollution, preserve soil fertility, and maintain the balance of gases in the atmosphere. We can protect biodiversity through the preservation of ecosystems. Just as a native fisherman who assists in overfishing a reef is doing away with his own food source, we as a society are contributing to the destruction of our home, the biosphere, when we destroy ecosystems. If instead we adopt a conservation ethic that preserves ecosystems, we are helping ensure the continued existence of all species, including our own.<br />

These are considered new, or emerging, diseases. Where do emerging diseases come from? Some may result from new and/or increased exposure to animals or insect populations that act as vectors for disease. Changes in human behavior and use of technology can also result in new diseases. SARS is thought to have arisen in Guandong, China, due to the consumption of civets, a type of exotic cat considered a delicacy. The civets were possibly infected by exposure to horseshoe bats sold in open markets. Legionnaires’ disease emerged in 1976 due to contamination of a large air-conditioning system in a hotel. The bacteria thrived in the cooling tower used as the water source for the air-conditioning system. In addition, globalization results in the transport of diseases all over the world that were previously restricted to isolated communities. The first SARS cases were reported in southern China the week of November 16, 2002. By the end of February 2003, SARS had reached nine countries/provinces, mostly through airline travel. Some pathogens mutate and change hosts, jumping from birds to humans, for example. Before 1997, avian flu was thought to affect only birds. A mutated strain jumped to humans in the 1997 outbreak. To control that epidemic, officials killed 1.5 million chickens to remove the source of the virus.<span> </span><br />

Climate change is primarily due to an imbalance in the chemical cycling of the element carbon. Normally, carbon is cycled within an ecosystem. However, due to human activities, more carbon dioxide is being released into the atmosphere than is being removed. In 1850, atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> was at about 280 parts per million (ppm); today, it is over 400 ppm. This increase is largely due to the burning of fossil fuels and the destruction of forests to make way for farmland and pasture. Today, the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere is about twice the amount that remains in the atmosphere. It’s believed that most of this dissolves in the ocean. The increased amount of carbon dioxide (and other gases) in the atmosphere is causing a rise in temperature called <b><a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-global-warming"><dfn title="global warming">global warming</dfn></a>.</b> These gases allow the sun’s rays to pass through, but they absorb and radiate heat back to Earth, a phenomenon called the greenhouse effect. Global warming is contributing to climate change, which is causing significant changes in many of the Earth’s ecosystems.

The question is, How can we apply our knowledge of life on Earth to detect life on other planets? Most likely, the life on moons such as Europa and Titan is not highly organized. Most scientists believe that simple multicellular organisms may be the only life-forms that can survive at this distance from the sun. Thus, future missions to planets and moons in our solar system will likely look for evidence of life-acquiring materials and using energy. When you eat food, you produce carbon dioxide and other waste products. Living organisms on other planets should do the same. By studying the extreme environments of the moons of Saturn and Jupiter, and our own planet, we may be better able to define the basic properties of life and what it really means when we say that something “is alive.”</p>
