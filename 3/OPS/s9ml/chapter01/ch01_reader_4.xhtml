Anecdotal data—which consist of testimonials by individuals rather than results from a controlled, clinical study—are never considered reliable data. An example of anecdotal data would be claims from people that a particular diet helped them lose weight. Obviously, this doesn’t mean the diet will work for everyone. Testimonial data are suspect because the effect of whatever is under discussion may not have been studied with a large number of subjects or a control group.</p>
        <p id="data-uuid-125d329352c149519b6a1759107ccf95" data-uuid="125d329352c149519b6a1759107ccf95">We must also keep in mind that just because two events occur at the same time, one factor may not be the cause of the other. Dr. Marshall had this problem when his data largely depended on finding <i>H. pylori</i> at the site of ulcers. More data were needed before the scientific community could conclude that <i>H. pylori</i> was the cause of an ulcer. Similarly, that a human papillomavirus (HPV) infection usually precedes cervical cancer could be viewed only as limited evidence that HPV causes cervical cancer. In this instance, HPV has turned out to be a cause of cervical cancer, but not all correlations (relationships) turn out to be causations. For example, scientific studies do not support the well-entrenched belief that exposure to cold temperatures results in colds. Instead, we now know that viruses cause colds.</p>

The methodology tells us how the scientists conducted their study, and the results tell us what facts (data) were discovered. Always keep in mind that the conclusion is not the same as the data. The conclusion is an interpretation of the data by the authors of the paper. Although scientific papers are reviewed by other scientists, ultimately it is up to us to decide if the conclusion is justified by the data.</p>

A graph shows the relationship between two quantities, such as the taking of an antibiotic and the disappearance of an ulcer. As in <a href="ch01_reader_3.xhtml#data-uuid-772d2c92fcb74e48a252afad93cab7ce" class="link-inline">Figure 1.9</a>, the experimental variable (study groups) is plotted on the <i>x</i>-axis (horizontal), and the result (effectiveness) is plotted along the <i>y</i>-axis (vertical). Graphs are useful tools to summarize data in a clear and simplified manner. For example, <a href="ch01_reader_3.xhtml#data-uuid-772d2c92fcb74e48a252afad93cab7ce" class="link-inline">Figure 1.9</a> immediately shows that antibiotic B produced the best results.</p>

For example, in <a href="ch01_reader_4.xhtml#data-uuid-14993efc0ae34e1991f6005b56e5aa3e" class="link-inline">Figure 1.10</a>, we can see that the investigators were studying blood cholesterol levels over a 4-week period. By looking at this graph, we know that the blood cholesterol levels were highest during week 2, and we can see to what degree the values varied over the course of the study.</p>

In statistics, the <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-standard-error"><dfn title="standard error">standard error</dfn></a> tells us how uncertain a particular value is. Suppose you predict how many hurricanes Florida will have next year by calculating the average number during the past 10 years. If the number of hurricanes per year varies widely, your standard error will be larger than if the number per year is usually about the same. In other words, the standard error tells you how far off the average could be. If the average number of hurricanes is four and the standard error is ± 2, then your prediction of four hurricanes is between two and six hurricanes. In <a href="ch01_reader_4.xhtml#data-uuid-14993efc0ae34e1991f6005b56e5aa3e" class="link-inline">Figure 1.10</a>, the standard error is represented by the bars above and below each data point. This provides a visual indication of the statistical analysis of the data.</p>

        <p id="data-uuid-226dfcdf4631483a9f9556bd09827570" data-uuid="226dfcdf4631483a9f9556bd09827570">When scientists conduct an experiment, there is always the possibility that the results are due to chance or to some factor other than the experimental variable. Investigators take into account several factors when they calculate the probability value (<i>p</i>) that their results were due to chance alone. If the probability value is low, researchers describe the results as statistically significant. A probability value of less than 5% (usually written as <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) is acceptable, but, even so, keep in mind that the lower the <i>p</i> value, the <i>less</i> likely that results are due to chance. Therefore, the lower the <i>p</i> value, the <i>greater</i> the confidence the investigators and you can have in the results. Depending on the type of study, most scientists like to have a <i>p</i> value of &lt;0.05, but <i>p</i> values of &lt;0.001 are common in many studies.</p>
