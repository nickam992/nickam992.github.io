When scientists study the natural world, they aim to be objective, rather than subjective. Objective observations are supported by factual information, whereas subjective observations involve personal judgment. For example, the fat content of a particular food would be an objective observation of a nutritional study. Reporting about the good or bad taste of the food would be a subjective observation. It is difficult to make objective observations and conclusions, because we are often influenced by our prejudices. Scientists must keep in mind that scientific conclusions can change because of new findings. New findings are often made because of recent advances in techniques or equipment.</p>

            other types of information available to us, scientific information is acquired

            important to note that the scientific method provides a general framework for
            how scientists study the world around them. The approach of individual
            scientists to their work is as varied as the scientists. However, much of the
            scientific process is descriptive. For example, an observation of a new disease
            may lead a scientist to describe all the aspects of the disease, such as the
            environment, the age of onset, and the characteristics of the disease. Some
            areas of biology, such as the study of biodiversity in the ecological sciences
            (see <a href="ch01_reader_5.xhtml#data-uuid-528bc2f571ac4ca5901e2f16b180c1d4" class="link-inline">section 1.5</a>), lend themselves more to this descriptive approach. Regardless
            of their area of study, most scientists spend a considerable amount of time
            performing a descriptive analysis of their observation before proceeding into
            the steps of the scientific method. For the sake of discussion, it is possible to
            speak of the scientific method as consisting of certain steps.<br />

Chance alone can help a scientist arrive at an idea. The most famous case pertains to the antibiotic penicillin, which was discovered in 1928. While examining a petri dish of bacteria that had accidentally become contaminated with the mold <i>Penicillium</i>, Alexander Fleming observed an area around the mold that was free of bacteria. Fleming had long been interested in finding cures for human diseases caused by bacteria, and he was very knowledgeable about antibacterial substances. So when Fleming saw the dramatic effect of <i>Penicillium</i> mold on bacteria, he reasoned that the mold might be producing an antibacterial substance. We call such a possible explanation for a natural event a <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-hypothesis"><dfn title="hypothesis">hypothesis</dfn></a>. A hypothesis is based on existing knowledge, so it is much more informed than a mere guess. Fleming’s hypothesis was supported by further study, but sometimes a hypothesis is not supported and must be either modified and subjected to additional study or rejected.<br />

Model organisms are chosen because they allow the researcher to control aspects of the experiment, such as age and genetic background. Cell biologists may use mice for modeling the effects of a new drug. Like model organisms, model systems allow the scientist to control specific variables and environmental conditions in a way that may not be possible in the natural environment. For example, ecologists may use computer programs to model how human activities will affect the climate of a specific ecosystem. While models provide useful information, they do not always answer the original question completely. For example, medicine that is effective in mice should ideally be tested in humans, and ecological experiments that are conducted using computer simulations need to be verified by actual field experiments. Biologists, and all other scientists, continuously design and revise their experiments to better understand how different factors may influence their original observation.<br />

Mathematical data are often displayed in the form of a graph or table. Sometimes studies rely on statistical data. Statistical analysis allows a scientist to detect relationships in the data that may not be obvious on the surface. Let’s say an investigator wants to know if eating onions can prevent women from getting osteoporosis (weak bones). The scientist conducts a survey asking women about their onion-eating habits and then correlates these data with the condition of their bones. Other scientists critiquing this study would want to know the following: How many women were surveyed? How old were the women? What were their exercise habits? What criteria were used to determine the condition of their bones? And what is the probability that the data are in error? The greater the variance in the data, the greater the probability of error. In any case, even if the data do suggest a correlation, scientists would want to know if there is a specific ingredient in onions that has a direct biochemical or physiological effect on bones. After all, correlation does not necessarily mean causation. It could be that women who eat onions eat lots of vegetables and have healthier diets overall than women who do not eat onions. In this way, scientists are skeptics who always pressure one another to keep investigating.<br />

When clinicians do an experiment, they try to vary just the experimental variables—in this case, the medications being tested.

                Elizabeth II Medical Center in Perth, Australia. There he saw many patients who
                had bleeding stomach ulcers. A pathologist at the hospital, Dr. J. Robin
                Warren, told him about finding a particular bacterium, now called <i>Helicobacter pylori</i>, near the site of peptic ulcers. Marshall
                compiled data showing a possible correlation between the presence of <i>H. pylori </i> and the occurrence of both gastritis
                (inflammation of the stomach) and stomach ulcers. On the basis of these data,
                Marshall formulated a hypothesis: <i>H. pylori</i> is the cause of gastritis and ulcers.<br />

                Koch’s criteria. He was able to isolate <i>H.
                pylori</i> from ulcer patients and grow
                it in the laboratory. Despite Marshall’s presentation of these findings to the
                scientific community, most physicians continued to believe that stomach acidity
                and stress were the causes of stomach ulcers. In those days, patients were
                usually advised to make drastic changes in their lifestyle to cure their
                ulcers. Many scientists believed that no bacterium would be able to survive the normal acidity of the stomach.</p>

                had a problem in fulfilling the third and fourth of Koch’s criteria. He had
                been unable to infect guinea pigs and rats with the bacteria, because the
                bacteria did not flourish in the intestinal tracts of those animals. Marshall
                was not able to use human subjects because of ethical reasons. Marshall was so
                determined to support his hypothesis that, in 1985, he decided to perform the experiment
                on himself! To the disbelief of those in the lab that day, he and another
                volunteer swallowed a foul-smelling, foul-tasting solution of <i>H. pylori. </i> Within the week, they felt lousy and were
                vomiting up their stomach contents. Examination by endoscopy showed that their
                stomachs were now inflamed, and biopsies of the stomach lining contained the
                suspected bacterium (Fig. 1B). Their symptoms abated without need for
                medication, and they never developed an ulcer. Marshall challenged the
                scientific community to refute his hypothesis. Many tried, but ultimately the
                investigators supported his findings. <br />

                number of subjects, are required before a conclusion can be reached. By the

                had been published showing that antibiotic therapy can eliminate <i>H. pylori</i> from the

Endoscopy, a procedure depicted in the photograph in <a href="ch01_reader_3.xhtml#data-uuid-772d2c92fcb74e48a252afad93cab7ce" class="link-inline">Figure 1.9</a>, is one way to examine a patient for the presence of ulcers. This procedure, which is performed under sedation, involves inserting an endoscope—a small, flexible tube with a tiny camera on the end—down the throat and into the stomach and the upper part of the intestine. Then, the doctor can see the lining of these organs and can check for ulcers. Tests performed during an endoscopy can also determine if <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> is present.</p>

When neither the patient nor the technician is aware of the specific treatment, it is called a <i>double-blind</i> study.</p>

The investigator who did the research is generally the primary author of a published study. Reading the actual results of the experiment tends to prevent the possibility of misinformation and/or bias. Do you remember playing “pass the message” when you were young? When someone started a message and it was passed around a circle of people, the last person to hear the message rarely received the original message. As each person passed along the message, information was added to or deleted from the original. That same thing may happen to scientific information when it is published in magazines or books or reported by someone other than the original investigator.</p>

The general public typically relies on secondary sources of information for its science news. Sometimes, the information may be out of context or misunderstood by the reporter, and the result is transmission of misinformation. Ideally, a reference to the original source (scientific journal article) will be provided, so that information can be verified. Remember also that it often takes years to do enough experiments for the scientific community to accept findings as well founded. Be wary of claims that have only limited data to support them and any information that may not be supported by repeated experimentation.</p>

Reliable, credible scientific information can often be found at websites with URLs containing .edu (for educational institution), .gov (for government sites such as the National Institutes of Health or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), and .org (for nonprofit organizations, such as the American Lung Association or the National Multiple Sclerosis Society). Unfortunately, quite a bit of scientific information on the Internet is intended to entice people into purchasing some sort of product for weight loss, prevention of hair loss, or similar maladies. These websites usually have URLs ending with .com or .net. It pays to question and verify the information from these websites with another source (primary, if possible).</p>
