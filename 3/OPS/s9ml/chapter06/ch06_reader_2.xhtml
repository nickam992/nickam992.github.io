They have no nucleus; their biconcave shape comes about because they lose their nucleus during maturation (see <a href="ch06_reader_1.xhtml#data-uuid-44fecbd098e04ed48aaf51893e7f6ca4" class="link-inline">Fig. 6.1</a>). The biconcave shape of RBCs gives them a greater surface area for the diffusion of gases into and out of the cell. All the internal space of RBCs is used for transport of oxygen. Aside from having no nucleus, RBCs also lack most organelles, including mitochondria. RBCs anaerobically produce ATP, and they do not consume any of the oxygen they transport.</p>

An enzyme inside RBCs, called <i>carbonic anhydrase,</i> speeds the reaction. Carbonic acid quickly separates, or dissociates<i>,</i> to form hydrogen ions (H<sup>+</sup>) and bicarbonate ions (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup>). The bicarbonate ions diffuse out of the RBCs to be carried in the plasma. The H<sup>+</sup> from this equation binds to globin, the protein portion of hemoglobin. Thus, hemoglobin assists plasma proteins and salts in keeping the blood pH constant. When blood reaches the lungs, the reaction is reversed (arrows pointing right to left). Hydrogen ions and bicarbonate ions reunite to re-form carbonic acid. The <i>carbonic anhydrase</i> enzyme also speeds this reverse reaction. Carbon dioxide diffuses out of the blood and into the airways of the lungs, to be exhaled from the body (also see <a href="../chapter10/ch10_reader_6.xhtml#data-uuid-ed9b8633e7674230aa746851a639951e" class="link-inline">Fig. 10.11</a>).</p>

As red blood cells mature, they acquire hemoglobin and lose their nucleus and other internal organelles. The lack of internal organelles means that RBCs are incapable of conducting many of the functions of other eukaryotic cells in the body. For example, because they lack mitochondria, RBCs are not able to carry out cellular respiration; instead they rely on the processes of glycolysis and fermentation. In addition, the cytoskeleton of RBCs contains proteins that provide their unique shape, thus allowing them to move through narrow capillary beds. Also, due to their lack of a nucleus, RBCs are unable to replenish important proteins and repair cellular damage. Therefore, red blood cells live only about 120 days. When they age, red blood cells are phagocytized by white blood cells (macrophages) in the liver and spleen.</p>

When red blood cells are broken down, hemoglobin is released. The globin portion of hemoglobin is broken down into its component amino acids, which are recycled by the body. The majority of the iron is recovered and returned to the bone marrow for reuse, although a small amount is lost and must be replaced in the diet. The rest of the heme portion of the molecule undergoes chemical degradation and is excreted by the liver and kidneys. The body has a way to boost the number of RBCs when insufficient oxygen is being delivered to the cells: The kidneys release a hormone called <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-erythropoietin-EPO"><dfn title="erythropoietin (EPO)">erythropoietin <em>(</em>EPO<em>)</em></dfn></a>, which stimulates the stem cells in bone marrow to produce more red blood cells (<a href="ch06_reader_2.xhtml#data-uuid-6bb53cf90cdd41dd8bd78c7fe8a0619e" class="link-inline">Fig. 6.4</a>).

Likewise, when skin is bruised, the chemical breakdown of heme causes the skin to change color from red/purple to blue to green to yellow. When there is an insufficient number of red blood cells or the cells do not have enough hemoglobin, the individual suffers from <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-anemia"><dfn title="anemia">anemia</dfn></a> and has a tired, run-down feeling. Iron, vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, and the B vitamin folic acid are necessary for the production of red blood cells. <i>Iron-deficiency anemia</i> is the most common form. It results from an inadequate intake of dietary iron, which causes insufficient hemoglobin synthesis. A lack of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> causes <i>pernicious anemia,</i> in which stem cell activity is reduced due to inadequate DNA production. As a consequence, fewer red blood cells are produced. <i>Folic-acid-deficiency anemia</i> also leads to a reduced number of RBCs, particularly during pregnancy. Pregnant women should consult with their health-care provider about the need to increase their intake of folic acid, because a deficiency can lead to birth defects in the newborn.</p>

To accomplish blood doping, athletes can inject themselves with EPO some months before the competition. These injections will increase the number of RBCs in their blood. Several weeks later, four units of their blood are removed and centrifuged to concentrate the RBCs. The concentrated RBCs are reinfused shortly before the athletic event. Blood doping is a dangerous, illegal practice. Several cyclists died in the 1990s from heart failure, probably due to blood that was too thick with cells for the heart to pump.</p>
