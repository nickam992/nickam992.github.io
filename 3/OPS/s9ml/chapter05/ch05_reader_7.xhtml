In the United States, CVD is responsible for more than 33% of all deaths. Modern research efforts have resulted in improved diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. This section discusses the range of advances that have been made, first in correcting vascular disorders and then in correcting heart disorders. The Bioethical feature, “<a href="ch05_reader_7.xhtml#data-uuid-e7e54942d5b1429bb5d018d3299f89c6" class="link-inline">Cardiovascular Disease Prevention</a>” later in this section includes risk factors that one should avoid to possibly prevent CVD from developing in the first place, while the Health feature, “<a href="ch05_reader_7.xhtml#data-uuid-c0617fb222064228831c35a2b64d272a" class="link-inline">New Information About Preventing Cardiovascular Disease</a>,” examines new evidence on the role of other factors, such as omega-3 fatty acids, in reducing CVD risk.</p>

Treatment involves removing the blood clot or prying open the affected artery. Another possible outcome is a burst blood vessel, or aneurysm. An aneurysm can be prevented by replacing a blood vessel that is about to rupture with an artificial one.</p>

Also known as high blood pressure, hypertension is sometimes called a silent killer. It may not be detected until it has caused a heart attack, stroke, or even kidney failure. Hypertension is present when the systolic blood pressure is 140 or greater or the diastolic blood pressure is 90 or greater (see <a href="ch05_reader_4.xhtml#data-uuid-adb73a3fa66f49529a9bcf2709fd019d" class="link-inline">Table 5.1</a>). Though systolic and diastolic pressures are both important, diastolic pressure is emphasized when medical treatment is being considered.</p>

If hypertension is present, prescription drugs can help lower blood pressure. Diuretics cause the kidneys to excrete more urine, ridding the body of excess fluid. In addition, hormones (the body’s chemical messengers) that raise blood pressure can be inactivated. Drugs called beta-blockers and ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors help control hypertension caused by hormones.</p>

In most instances, atherosclerosis begins in early adulthood and develops progressively through middle age, but symptoms may not appear until an individual is 50 or older. To prevent the onset and development of atherosclerosis, the American Heart Association and other organizations recommend a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol but rich in omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids.</p>

As long as the clot remains stationary, it is called a thrombus. If the thrombus dislodges and moves along with the blood, it is called an embolus. A <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-thromboembolism"><dfn title="thromboembolism">thromboembolism</dfn></a> consists of a clot first carried in the bloodstream that then becomes completely stationary when it lodges in a small blood vessel.

Chief among these are smoking and a diet rich in lipids and cholesterol. Research also indicates that a low-level bacterial or viral infection that spreads to the blood may cause an injury that starts the process of atherosclerosis. Surprisingly, such an infection may originate with gum diseases or be due to <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> (see <a href="../chapter01/ch01_reader_0.xhtml" class="link-inline">Chapter 1</a>). People who have high levels of C-reactive protein, which occurs in the blood following a cold or an injury, are more likely to have a heart attack.</p>

Cholesterol is ferried in the blood by two proteins: LDL (low-density lipoprotein, the “bad” lipoprotein) and HDL (high-density lipoprotein, the “good” lipoprotein). LDL carries its cholesterol to deposit in tissues, but HDL carries cholesterol to the liver, where it can be metabolized. Elevated blood LDL and/or low blood HDL levels can contribute to cardiovascular disease. A diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol can help to restore LDL and HDL to recommended levels. Drugs called statins can further lower the LDL level, if necessary.</p>

But recent research suggests that a moderate level of alcohol intake can improve cardiovascular health by improving the blood cholesterol profile, decreasing unwanted clot formation, increasing blood flow in the heart, and reducing blood pressure. According to the American Heart Association, people who consume one or two drinks per day have a 30–50% reduction in cardiovascular disease compared to nondrinkers.</p>

A surgeon takes a blood vessel—usually a vein from the leg—and stitches one end to the aorta and the other end to a coronary artery located past the point of obstruction. <a href="ch05_reader_7.xhtml#data-uuid-25bf07593b5c4013bfd22e00900cc00b" class="link-inline">Figure 5.14<i>b</i></a> shows a triple bypass in which three blood vessel segments have been used to allow blood to flow freely from the aorta to cardiac muscle by way of the coronary artery. Since 1997, gene therapy has been used instead of a coronary bypass to grow new blood vessels that will carry blood to cardiac muscle. The surgeon needs only to make a small incision and inject many copies of the gene that codes for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) between the ribs directly into the area of the heart that most needs improved blood flow. The VEGF encourages new blood vessels to sprout out of an artery. If collateral blood vessels do form, they transport blood past clogged arteries, making bypass surgery unnecessary. About 60% of patients who undergo the procedure show signs of vessel growth within 2 to 4 weeks.</p>

A stent is a small metal mesh cylinder that holds a coronary artery open after a blockage has been cleared. During <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-angioplasty"><dfn title="angioplasty">angioplasty</dfn></a><b>,</b> a plastic tube was inserted into an artery of an arm or a leg and then guided through a major blood vessel toward the heart. When the tube reached the region of plaque in an artery, a balloon attached to the end of the tube was inflated, forcing the vessel open. Now, instead, a stent with an inner balloon is pushed into the blocked area. When the balloon inside the stent is inflated, it expands, locking itself in place. Some patients go home the same day or, at most, after an overnight stay. The stent is more successful when it is coated with a drug that seeps into the artery lining and discourages cell growth. Uncoated stents can close back up in a few months, but the drug used in the coated ones successfully discourages closure. Blood clotting might occur after stent placement, so recipients have to take anticlotting medications.</p>

Heart failure is a growing problem, because people who used to die from heart attacks now survive but are left with damaged hearts. Often the heart is oversized, not because the cardiac wall is stronger but because it is sagging and swollen. One idea is to wrap the heart in a fabric sheath to prevent it from getting too big. This might allow better pumping, similar to the way a weight lifter’s belt restricts and reinforces stomach muscles. But a failing heart can have other problems, such as an abnormal heart rhythm. To counter that condition, it’s possible to place an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) just beneath the skin of the chest. This device can sense both an abnormally slow and an abnormally fast heartbeat. If the former, the ICD generates the missing beat, as a pacemaker does. If the latter, it sends the heart a sharp jolt of electricity to slow it down. If the heart rhythm becomes erratic, the ICD sends an even stronger shock—as a defibrillator does.</p>

Today, only about 2,300 heart transplants are done annually, though many thousands of people could use them. Genetically altered pigs may one day be used as a source of hearts because of the shortage of human hearts. Also, bone marrow stem cells have been injected into the heart. Once in the heart, these cells have been able to form new cardiac muscle tissue to replace tissue damaged by a heart attack.</p>

Another option is the Jarvik 2000, which is a pump inserted inside the left ventricle. The Jarvik is powered by an external battery no larger than a C battery.</p>

However, medical advances have increased the survival time to months for many recipients, making the TAH a temporary treatment for people who are experiencing heart failure. To date, over 1,300 TAHs have been implanted into patients.</p>

He learned what a blood pressure value of 132/84 mm Hg really meant. The larger number (132) represented the maximum pressure as his heart was beating, while the smaller number (84) was the resting pressure. Ideally, his blood pressure should have been less than 120/80 mm Hg, so as his doctor indicated, Steven was prehypertensive. However, the good news was that at his age, prehypertension was largely due to lifestyle choices, namely diet and physical activity. Therefore, Steven resolved to watch his diet more closely, especially the amount of saturated fat and cholesterol, and increase his cardiovascular workouts per week. His doctor also recommended a follow-up visit in a few months to ensure that Steven was making satisfactory progress.</p>
