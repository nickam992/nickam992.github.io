For example, what we call “strep throat” is a primary bacterial infection, caused by <i>Streptococcus pyogenes,</i> that can lead to a generalized URI and even a systemic (affecting the body as a whole) infection. The symptoms of strep throat are severe sore throat, high fever, and white patches on a dark red throat. Because strep throat is bacterial, it can be treated successfully with antibiotics.</p>

Symptoms include postnasal discharge and facial pain that worsens when the patient bends forward. Pain and tenderness usually occur over the lower forehead or over the cheeks (sometimes also producing toothaches). Successful treatment depends on restoring proper drainage of the sinuses. Even a hot shower and sleeping upright can be helpful. Nasal spray decongestants and oral antihistamines also alleviate the symptoms of sinusitis. Sprays may be preferred, because they treat the symptoms without the side effects, such as drowsiness, of oral medicine. However, nasal sprays can become habit forming if used for long periods. Persistent sinusitis should be evaluated by a health-care professional.</p>

This infection is considered here because it is a complication often seen in children who have a nasal infection. Infection can spread by way of the auditory tube from the nasopharynx to the middle ear. Pain is the primary symptom of a middle-ear infection. A sense of fullness, hearing loss, vertigo (dizziness), and fever may also be present. Antibiotics are prescribed if necessary, but physicians are aware today that overuse of antibiotics can lead to resistance of bacteria to antibiotics (see <a href="../chapter08/ch08_reader_3.xhtml#data-uuid-2a0b3058cf75495994d619a92783f152" class="link-inline">section 8.4</a>). Tubes (called tympanostomy tubes) are sometimes placed in the eardrums of children with multiple recurrences to help prevent the buildup of pressure in the middle ear and reduce the possibility of hearing loss. Normally, the tubes fall out with time.</p>

Most often, it is preceded by influenza. High fever and chills with headache and chest pain are symptoms of pneumonia. Rather than being a generalized lung infection, pneumonia may be localized in specific lobules of the lungs. Obviously, the more lobules involved, the more serious is the infection. Pneumonia can be caused by a bacterium that is usually held in check but has gained the upper hand due to stress and/or reduced immunity. AIDS patients are subject to a particularly rare form of pneumonia caused by a fungus named <i>Pneumocystis jiroveci</i> (formerly <i>Pneumocystis carinii</i>)<i>.</i> Pneumonia of this type is almost never seen in individuals with a healthy immune system.</p>

When the bacteria (<i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>) invade the lung tissue, the cells build a protective capsule around the foreigners, isolating them from the rest of the body. This tiny capsule is called a tubercle. If the resistance of the body is high, the imprisoned organisms die, but if the resistance is low, the organisms eventually can be liberated. If a chest X-ray detects active tubercles, the individual is put on appropriate drug therapy to ensure the localization of the disease and the eventual destruction of any live bacteria. It is possible to tell if a person has ever been exposed to tuberculosis with a <i>tuberculin</i> test. This procedure uses a highly diluted bacterial extract injected into the patient’s skin. If a tuberculin test is positive, an X-ray will be done to confirm an active disease. A person may have a positive test but no active disease.</p>

Though cystic fibrosis is usually considered to be just a disease of the respiratory system, because this is where the symptoms usually first appear, it can also cause problems in organs such as the pancreas. Just a few decades ago, people with cystic fibrosis usually died before the age of 20. New advances in medicine and treatments now enable individuals to live into their thirties and forties.</p>

As a result, the surface area available for gas exchange is reduced. Emphysema, most often caused by smoking, is often preceded by chronic bronchitis. Air trapped in the lungs leads to alveolar damage and a noticeable ballooning of the chest. The elastic recoil of the lungs is reduced, so not only are the airways narrowed but the driving force behind expiration is also reduced. The victim is breathless and may have a cough. The surface area for gas exchange is reduced, so less oxygen reaches the heart and the brain. Even so, the heart works furiously to force more blood through the lungs, and an increased workload on the heart can result. Lack of oxygen to the brain can make the person feel depressed, sluggish, and irritable. Exercise, drug therapy, supplemental oxygen, and giving up smoking may relieve the symptoms and slow the progression of emphysema. Severe emphysema may be treated by lung transplantation or lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS). During LVRS, a third of the most diseased lung tissue is removed. The removal enables the remaining tissue to function better. The result is an increase in the patient’s breathing ability and lung capacity.</p>

Even cold air can be an irritant. When exposed to the irritant, the smooth muscle in the bronchioles undergoes spasms. It now appears that chemical mediators given off by immune cells in the bronchioles cause the spasms. Most asthma patients have some degree of bronchial inflammation that further reduces the diameter of the airways and contributes to the seriousness of an attack. Asthma is not curable, but it is treatable. Special inhalers can control the inflammation and possibly prevent an attack, and other types of inhalers can stop the muscle spasms, should an attack occur.</p>

                young people start smoking? Some may want to look mature or “cool,” to be
                accepted by friends, or to rebel against authority. Some smokers believe the habit helps them control
                their weight; others admit they simply enjoy the “buzz” that nicotine can
                provide. Because of the unhealthy side effects of smoking, people often look

                “e-liquid” that consists mainly of nicotine plus propylene glycol or vegetable
                glycerin. When the device is used, a battery heats the liquid, turning it into
                a vapor that can be inhaled (explaining the popular term “vaping” for this
                practice). Often an LED light at the tip
                glows, mimicking a lit cigarette. There’s no cigarette smell, though, because

                from an e-cig is much safer than cigarette smoke. In contrast, many health experts are
                concerned that the effects of inhaling pure nicotine vapor haven’t yet been
                sufficiently studied. The nicotine
                content of e-liquids can be quite variable, and a variety of
                contaminants—including metals and trace levels of certain carcinogens—have been
                detected. And while some smokers say using e-cigs helped them quit cigarettes,
                health authorities worry that people who first become hooked on vaping might
                “graduate” to smoking. </p>

                companies claim they aren’t marketing to children, some nicotine solutions
                contain flavors—such as butterscotch, chocolate, and even cotton candy—that
                could appeal to the very young. An April 2014 <i>New York Times</i> article titled “Selling a Poison by the Barrel”
                characterized e-liquids as powerful neurotoxins, which when ingested or even
                absorbed through the skin, can be lethal, and poisonings due to contact with or
                ingestion of e-liquids are on the rise. <br />

                Considering all the health risks associated with smoking, it’s unlikely that
                vaping could be worse. Still, until many issues with e-cigs can be sorted out,
                it is clearly best to follow the FDA’s advice and avoid vaping as well. <br />

The increase in the incidence of lung cancer in women is directly related to increased numbers of women who smoke. Autopsies on smokers have revealed the progressive steps by which the most common form of lung cancer develops. The first event appears to be thickening and callusing of the cells lining the bronchi. (Callusing occurs whenever cells are exposed to irritants.) Then cilia are lost, making it impossible to prevent dust and dirt from settling in the lungs. Following this, cells with atypical nuclei appear in the callused lining. A tumor consisting of disordered cells with atypical nuclei is considered cancer in situ (at one location). A normal lung versus a lung with cancerous tumors is shown in <a href="ch10_reader_7.xhtml#data-uuid-75d082d0ee3449f0a774bb0b7ed307d3" class="link-inline">Figure 10.13</a>. A final step occurs when some of these cells break loose and penetrate other tissues, a process called metastasis. Now the cancer has spread. The original tumor may grow until a bronchus is blocked, cutting off the supply of air to that lung. The entire lung then collapses, the secretions trapped in the lung spaces become infected, and pneumonia or a lung abscess (localized area of pus) results. The only treatment that offers a possibility of cure is to remove a lobe or the whole lung before metastasis has had time to occur. This operation is called <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-pneumonectomy"><dfn title="pneumonectomy">pneumonectomy</dfn></a><b>.</b> If the cancer has spread, chemotherapy and radiation are also required.</p>

Nicotine Anonymous offers a 12-step program for kicking a nicotine addiction, modeled after the 12-step Alcoholics Anonymous program. Recovering smokers have reported that a support system is very important. Several smoking-cessation drugs have been approved by the FDA, and others are in development phases. One such drug, varenicline (Chantix), affects areas in the brain stimulated by nicotine. Varenicline may lessen withdrawal symptoms by mimicking the effects of nicotine. In addition, several over-the-counter products are available to replace nicotine. These include nicotine patches, gum, and lozenges. These products are designed to supply enough nicotine to alleviate the withdrawal symptoms people experience during attempts to stop smoking.</p>

Over the 7-hour test period, Justin experienced an average of five apnea events per hour. His blood oxygen concentration was also low during these periods. The brain wave tests did not indicate anything abnormal, suggesting that the problem was associated with obstructive sleep apnea, not central sleep apnea.</p>
            <p id="data-uuid-4c7c03359dd045ecad4ca30a67afa67b" data-uuid="4c7c03359dd045ecad4ca30a67afa67b">As a first level of treatment, Justin’s doctor suggested that he increase his exercise, shed the extra pounds, and reduce his use of alcohol. In addition, he scheduled Justin to be fitted for a device called a CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) mask. The device delivers a constant flow of air into the upper respiratory tract. This keeps the airways open, reducing the frequency of apnea events. Justin would have to use the device nightly, because the CPAP mask was not a cure for obstructive sleep apnea. If diet and exercise did not restore Justin’s normal sleep patterns, the other option would be surgery to remove some of the soft tissues in the pharynx region, a procedure called an uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP). However, Justin’s doctor was confident that his changes in lifestyle and use of the CPAP mask would help reduce Justin’s occurrences of sleep apnea.</p>
