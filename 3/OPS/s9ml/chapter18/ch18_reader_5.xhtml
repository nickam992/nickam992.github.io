Infancy, the toddler years, and the preschool years are times of remarkable growth. During the birth to 5-year-old stage, humans acquire gross motor and fine motor skills. These include the ability to sit up and then to walk, as well as to hold a spoon and manipulate small objects. Language usage begins during this time and will become increasingly sophisticated throughout childhood. As infants and toddlers explore their environment, their senses—vision, taste, hearing, smell, and touch—mature dramatically. Socialization is very important as a child forms emotional ties with its caregivers and learns to separate self from others. Babies do not all develop at the same rate, and there is a large variation in what is considered normal.</p>

Preadolescents form identities apart from parents, and peer approval becomes very important. Adolescence begins with the onset of puberty as the young person achieves sexual maturity. For girls, puberty begins between 10 and 14 years of age, whereas for boys it generally occurs between ages 12 and 16. During this time, the sex-specific hormones (see <a href="../chapter16/ch16_reader_0.xhtml" class="link-inline">Chapter 16</a>) cause the secondary sex characteristics to appear. Profound social and psychological changes are also associated with the transition from childhood to adulthood.</p>

Today, <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-gerontology"><dfn title="gerontology">gerontology</dfn></a><b>,</b> the study of aging, is of great interest, because there are now more older individuals in our society than ever before. The number is expected to rise dramatically; in the next half-century, the number of people over age 65 will increase 147%. The human lifespan is judged to be a maximum of 120 to 125 years. The present goal of gerontology is not necessarily to increase the lifespan but to increase the health span, the number of years that an individual enjoys the full functions of all body parts and processes (<a href="ch18_reader_5.xhtml#data-uuid-b4437a9edc5646568b12fdd1be879d98" class="link-inline">Fig. 18.14</a>).</p>

Most scientists who study gerontology believe that aging is partly genetically preprogrammed. This idea is supported by the observation that longevity runs in families—that is, the children of long-lived parents tend to live longer than those of short-lived parents. As would also be expected, studies show that identical twins have a more similar lifespan than nonidentical twins.</p>
        <h3 id="data-uuid-342952aa64cf48c09aa39ac1e568575c" data-uuid="342952aa64cf48c09aa39ac1e568575c">Hormones</h3>

For example, mutations that decrease the activity of a hormone receptor similar to the insulin receptor more than double the lifespan of the worms, which also behave and look like much younger worms throughout their prolonged lives. Interestingly, small breed dogs, such as poodles and terriers, which may live 15 to 20 years, have lower levels of an analogous receptor compared to large breed dogs that live 6 to 8 years.</p>

Most types of differentiated cells can divide only a limited number of times. One factor that may control the number of cell divisions is the length of the <i>telomeres,</i> sequences of DNA, at the ends of chromosomes. Telomeres protect the ends of chromosomes from deteriorating or fusing with other chromosomes. Each time a cell divides, the telomeres normally shorten, and cells with shorter telomeres tend to undergo fewer divisions (see <a href="../chapter19/ch19_reader_2.xhtml#data-uuid-542d960d30524a9a82e2c27c778c5e5b" class="link-inline">section 19.2</a>). Some cells, such as stem cells, possess an enzyme called telomerase, which replenishes the length of the telomeres, effectively making stem cells immortal. Cancer cells, which behave in a similar manner to stem cells, frequently possess an active telomerase enzyme, which allows them to replicate continuously (see <a href="../chapter20/ch20_reader_1.xhtml#data-uuid-e128db7a06f34e978c77998069b42276" class="link-inline">section 20.1</a>). Studies using stem cells and cancer cells have begun to close in on the genetic factors that cause cellular aging. For example, in 2012 researchers used <i>gene therapy</i> (see <a href="../chapter22/ch22_reader_4.xhtml#data-uuid-b260ddca9c784a319ed9139823772115" class="link-inline">section 22.4</a>) to introduce an active telomerase enzyme into mice, thus slowing the aging process.</p>

        <p id="data-uuid-22984d10ccf04462a6c8f4b3a1969da9" data-uuid="22984d10ccf04462a6c8f4b3a1969da9">The mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell (see <a href="../chapter03/ch03_reader_6.xhtml#data-uuid-909020e63be84dd18a80d337aaa59ab6" class="link-inline">section 3.6</a>). As the mitochondria harvest the energy contained in carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, they generate free radicals. Free radicals are unstable molecules that carry an extra electron. To become stable, free radicals donate an electron to another molecule, such as DNA, proteins (e.g., enzymes), or lipids found in plasma membranes. Eventually, these molecules are unable to function, and the cell loses internal functions. This may lead to cell death. Scientists have determined that high-calorie diets increase the levels of free radicals, thus accelerating cellular aging. Multiple studies on model organisms, including mice, have supported that a low-calorie diet can extend the lifespan. It is also possible to reduce the negative effects of free radicals by increasing one’s consumption of natural antioxidants, such as those present in brightly colored and dark-green vegetables and fruits. Chemicals in nuts, fish, shellfish, and red wine have also been shown to reduce our exposure to free radicals and slow the aging process.</p>

For this reason, experts have estimated that in most cases, genes account only for about 25% of what determines the length of life.</p>

        <p id="data-uuid-5ed9fcfbe8e44e418965aec718a8c0ea" data-uuid="5ed9fcfbe8e44e418965aec718a8c0ea">Another set of hypotheses propose that aging involves the accumulation of damage over time. In 1900, the average human life expectancy was around 45 years. A baby born in the United States this year has a life expectancy of about 78 years.  Because human genes have presumably not changed much in such a short time, most of this gain in lifespan is due to better medical care, along with the application of scientific knowledge about how to prolong our lives.</p>
        <p id="data-uuid-99cebfe0775646dd8bb86e14895d1758" data-uuid="99cebfe0775646dd8bb86e14895d1758">Two basic types of cellular damage can accumulate over time. The first type can be thought of as agents that are unavoidable—for example, the accumulation of harmful DNA mutations or the buildup of harmful metabolites. A second form involves the fact that proteins—such as the collagen fibers present in many support tissues—may become increasingly cross-linked as people age. This cross-linking may account for the inability of such organs as the blood vessels, heart, and lungs to function as they once did. Some researchers have now found that glucose has the tendency to attach to any type of protein, which is the first step in a cross-linking process. They are currently experimenting with drugs that can prevent cross-linking. However, other sources of cellular damage may be avoidable, such as a poor diet or exposure to the sun.</p>

Aging reduces the ability of an organ system to perform these functions and in many cases impacts its ability  to contribute to homeostasis. Therefore, it seems appropriate to first consider the effects of aging on the various body systems.</p>

There is also less adipose tissue in the subcutaneous layer; therefore, older people are more likely to feel cold. Together, these changes typically result in sagging and wrinkling of the skin.</p>
        <p id="data-uuid-d5c26880d17e478fb1711d519349da25" data-uuid="d5c26880d17e478fb1711d519349da25">As people age, the sweat glands also become less active, resulting in decreased tolerance to high temperatures. There are fewer hair follicles, so the hair on the scalp and the limbs thins out. Older people also experience a decrease in the number of melanocytes, making their hair gray and their skin pale. In contrast, some of the remaining pigment cells are larger, and pigmented blotches (“age spots”) appear on the skin.</p>
        <h3 id="data-uuid-497b90bffa1d4f8e936c878fb1a348ca" data-uuid="497b90bffa1d4f8e936c878fb1a348ca">Cardiovascular System</h3>
        <p id="data-uuid-85c0355366f44bcb8da7605308232cc3" data-uuid="85c0355366f44bcb8da7605308232cc3">Common problems with cardiovascular function are usually related to diseases, especially atherosclerosis. However, even with normal aging, the heart muscle weakens somewhat and may increase slightly in size as it compensates for its decreasing strength. The maximum heart rate decreases even among the most fit older athletes, and it takes longer for the heart rate and blood pressure to return to normal resting levels following stress. Some part of this decrease in heart function may also be due to blood leaking back through heart valves that have become less flexible.</p>
        <p id="data-uuid-5909a3836d674afabc01e22aded81fbf" data-uuid="5909a3836d674afabc01e22aded81fbf">Aging also affects the blood vessels. The middle layer of arteries contains elastic fibers, which, like collagen fibers in the skin, become more cross-linked and rigid with time. These changes, plus a frequent decrease in the internal diameter of arteries due to atherosclerosis, contribute to a gradual increase in blood pressure with age. Indeed, nearly 50% of older adults have chronic hypertension. Such changes are common in individuals living in Western industrialized countries but not in agricultural societies. This indicates that a diet low in cholesterol and saturated fatty acids, along with a sensible exercise program, may help prevent age-related cardiovascular disease.</p>

Because a healthy immune system normally protects the entire body from infections, toxins, and at least some types of cancer, some investigators believe that losses in immune function can play a major role in the aging process.</p>
        <p id="data-uuid-bd7d93f7016f4488b6669141b8673984" data-uuid="bd7d93f7016f4488b6669141b8673984">The thymus is an important site for T-cell maturation. Beginning in adolescence, the thymus begins to involute, gradually decreasing in size and eventually becoming replaced by fat and connective tissue. The thymus of a 60-year-old adult is about 5% of the size of the thymus of a newborn, resulting in a decrease in the ability of older people to generate T-cell responses to new antigens. The evolutionary rationale for this may be that the thymus is energetically expensive for an organism to maintain; compared to younger animals that must respond to a high number of new infections and other antigens, older animals have already responded to most of the antigens to which they will be exposed in their life.</p>
        <p id="data-uuid-5b729ca0790143f596f88c1707bd612e" data-uuid="5b729ca0790143f596f88c1707bd612e">Aging also affects other immune functions. Because most B-cell responses are dependent on T cells, antibody responses also begin to decline. This, in turn, may explain why the elderly do not respond as well to vaccinations as young people do. This presents challenges in protecting older people against diseases such as influenza and pneumonia, which can otherwise be prevented by annual vaccination.</p>
        <p id="data-uuid-cb950d6cffdf4f2facbb53b45bf444dd" data-uuid="cb950d6cffdf4f2facbb53b45bf444dd">Not all immune functions decrease with age. The activity of natural killer cells, which are a part of the innate immune system, seems to change very little with age. Perhaps by investigating how these cells remain active throughout a normal human lifespan, researchers can learn to preserve other aspects of immunity in the elderly.</p>

Because secretion of saliva decreases, more bacteria tend to adhere to the teeth, causing more decay and periodontal disease. Blood flow to the liver is reduced, resulting in less efficient metabolism of drugs or toxins. This means that, as a person gets older, less medication is needed to maintain the same level in the bloodstream.</p>

Decreasing elasticity of lung tissues means that ventilation is reduced. Because we rarely use the entire vital capacity, these effects may not be noticed unless the demand for oxygen increases, such as during exercise.</p>

The kidneys become smaller and less efficient at filtering wastes. Salt and water balance are difficult to maintain, and the elderly dehydrate faster than young people. Urinary incontinence (lack of bladder control) increases with age, especially in women. In men, an enlarged prostate gland may reduce the diameter of the urethra, causing frequent or difficult urination.</p>

Neurons are extremely sensitive to oxygen deficiency, and neuron death may be due not to aging itself but to reduced blood flow in narrowed blood vessels. However, contrary to previous scientific opinion, recent studies using advanced imaging techniques show that most age-related loss in brain function is not due to whatever loss of neurons is occurring. Instead, decreased function may occur due to alterations in complex chemical reactions or increased inflammation in the brain. For example, an age-associated decline in levels of dopamine can affect brain regions involved in complex thinking.</p>

For example, animals on restricted-calorie diets developed fewer Alzheimer-like changes in their brains. For more on Alzheimer disease, see the Health feature, “Alzheimer Disease,” later in this section. Other positive factors that may help maintain a healthy brain include attending college (the “use it or lose it” idea), regular exercise, and sufficient sleep.</p>

A majority of people over age 80 have a significant decline in their sense of smell, and about 15% suffer from anosmia, or a total inability to smell. The latter condition can be a serious health hazard, due to the inability to detect smoke, gas leaks, or spoiled food. After age 50, most people gradually begin to lose the ability to hear tones at higher frequencies, and this can make it difficult to identify individual voices and to understand conversation in a group.</p>

Finally, cataracts and other eye disorders become much more common in the aged.</p>

Beginning in the twenties or thirties, but accelerating with increasing age, muscle mass generally decreases, due to decreases in both the size and number of muscle fibers. Most people who reach age 90 have 50% less muscle mass than when they were 20. Although some of this loss may be inevitable, regular exercise can slow this decline.</p>

Due to compression of the vertebrae, along with changes in posture, most of us lose height as we age. Those who reach age 80 will be about 2 in. shorter than they were in their twenties. Women lose bone mass more rapidly than men do, especially after menopause. Osteoporosis is a common disease in the elderly. Although some decline in bone mass is a normal result of aging, certain extrinsic factors are also important. A proper diet and a moderate exercise program have been found to slow the progressive loss of bone mass.</p>

These changes are complex, however, with some hormone levels tending to decrease with age, while others increase. The activity of the thyroid gland generally declines, resulting in a lower basal metabolic rate. The production of insulin by the pancreas may remain stable, but cells become less sensitive to its effects, resulting in a rise in fasting glucose levels of about 10 mg/dl each decade after age 50.</p>

After age 30, testosterone levels decrease by about 1% per year. Extremely low testosterone levels have been linked to a decreased sex drive, excessive weight gain, loss of muscle mass, osteoporosis, general fatigue, and depression. However, the levels below which testosterone treatment should be initiated remain controversial. Testosterone replacement therapy, whether through injection, patches, or gels, is associated with side effects such as enlargement of the prostate, acne or other skin reactions, and the production of too many red blood cells.</p>

A neuron that has been affected by Alzheimer disease has two characteristic features. Bundles of fibrous protein, called neurofibrillary tangles, extend from the axon to surround the nucleus of the neuron. Tangles form when the supporting protein, called tau, becomes malformed (<a href="ch18_reader_5.xhtml#data-uuid-2f90de7fdc6a4e899e394d17dcf8f2c6" class="link-inline">Fig. 18B</a>) and twists the neurofibrils, which are normally straight. In addition, protein-rich accumulations called amyloid plaques envelop branches of the axon. The plaques grow so dense that they trigger an inflammatory reaction that causes neuron death.</p>

Cholinesterase inhibitors work at neuron synapses in the brain, slowing the activity of acetylcholinesterase, the enzyme that breaks down ACh. Allowing ACh to accumulate in synapses keeps memory pathways in the brain functional for a longer period. The second drug, memantine, blocks <i>excitotoxicity,</i> the tendency of diseased neurons to self-destruct. This recently approved medication is used only in moderately to severely affected patients. Using the drug allows neurons involved in memory pathways to survive longer in affected patients. Successes with these medications indicates that treatment for AD patients should begin as soon as possible after diagnosis and continue indefinitely. However, neither type of medication cures the disease; both merely slow the progress of  symptoms, allowing the patient to function independently for a longer time. Additional research is currently under way to test the effectiveness of anticholesterol <i>statin</i> drugs, as well as anti-inflammatory medications, in slowing the progress of the disease.</p>

Scientists believe that a cure will require an early diagnosis, because it is thought that the disease may begin in the brain 15 to 20 years before symptoms develop. Currently, diagnosis can’t be made with absolute certainty until the brain is examined at autopsy. A new test on the cerebrospinal fluid may allow early detection of amyloid proteins and a much earlier diagnosis. Researchers are also testing vaccines, which would target the patient’s immune system to destroy amyloid plaques.</p>

A variation of one gene, <i>FOX03A,</i> has been identified to be more prevalent in centenarians than in the general population. This gene regulates the insulin pathways of the body and appears to control the genetic mechanisms that protect cells against free radicals. Both insulin regulation and protection against free radicals have been known for some time to enhance longevity in a variety of organisms. Interestingly, <i>FOX03A</i> is also believed to be involved in the process of apoptosis and may help protect the body against cancer. Although researchers do not think that <i>FOX03A</i> is the sole gene for longevity, it is providing a starting point for larger studies on human aging.</p>

The ovaries become unresponsive to the gonadotropic hormones produced by the anterior pituitary, and they no longer secrete estrogen or progesterone. At the onset of menopause, the uterine cycle becomes irregular, but as long as menstruation occurs, it is still possible for a woman to conceive. Therefore, a woman is usually not considered to have completed menopause (and thus be infertile) until menstruation has been absent for a year.</p>

To ease these symptoms, female hormone replacement therapy (HRT) was routinely prescribed until 2002, when a large clinical study showed that in the long term, HRT caused more health problems than it prevented. For this reason, most doctors no longer recommend long-term HRT for the prevention of postmenopausal symptoms.</p>

Because Amber was over 35 years old when she conceived her first child, the doctor recommended that a chorionic villus sampling test be done to test for birth defects, such as Down syndrome. In addition, the doctor performed a glucose tolerance test to determine if Amber was experiencing gestational diabetes. An additional blood test, called an alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) test, screened for neural tube defects and additional evidence of Down syndrome. Much to the relief of Amber and Kent, all these tests came back normal. Then, around week 20 of Amber’s pregnancy, the doctor made an appointment for Amber to get an ultrasound exam, which is frequently used to confirm the due date of the baby but can also be used to look for birth defects such as cleft palate. Everything once again appeared normal. Finally, the technician asked the parents the question they had been waiting for: Were they interested in knowing the sex of their baby? Within a few minutes, Amber and Kent found out that in just a few months they would be the parents of a baby girl.</p>
