The blood of the mother and blood of the fetus never mix, because exchange always takes place across the villi via diffusion. Carbon dioxide and other wastes move from the fetal side to the maternal side. Nutrients and oxygen move from the maternal side to the fetal side of the placenta. As discussed in the Health feature, “Preventing and Testing for Birth Defects,” harmful chemicals can also cross the placenta, and this is of particular concern during the embryonic period, when various structures are first forming. Each organ or part seems to have a sensitive period during which a substance can alter its normal function.</p>

It is the lifeline of the fetus because it contains the umbilical arteries and vein (<a href="ch18_reader_3.xhtml#data-uuid-63f9ec8da026497aa3ff5e880820a32b" class="link-inline">Fig. 18.7</a>). Blood in the fetal aorta travels to its various branches, including the iliac arteries. The iliac arteries connect to the <i>umbilical arteries</i> carrying O<sub>2</sub>-poor blood to the placenta. The <i>umbilical vein</i> carries blood rich in nutrients and O<sub>2</sub> from the placenta to the fetus. The umbilical vein enters the liver and then joins the <i>ductus venosus</i> (venous duct). This merges with the inferior vena cava, a vessel that returns blood to the right atrium. This mixed blood enters the heart, and most of it is shunted to the left atrium through the <i>foramen ovale</i> (oval opening). The left ventricle pumps this blood into the aorta. Oxygen-poor blood that enters the right atrium is pumped into the pulmonary trunk. It then joins the aorta by way of the <i>ductus arteriosus</i> (arterial duct). Therefore, most blood entering the right atrium bypasses the lungs.</p>

For example, women of childbearing age are urged to make sure they consume adequate amounts of folic acid (a B vitamin) to prevent neural tube defects, such as spina bifida and anencephaly. In spina bifida, part of the vertebral column fails to develop properly and cannot adequately protect the spinal cord. With anencephaly, most of the fetal brain fails to develop. Anencephalic infants are stillborn or survive for only a few days after birth.</p>

The CDC recommends that all women of childbearing age get at least 400 micrograms (<span class="text-serif">µ</span>g) of folic acid every day through supplements, in addition to eating a healthy, folic acid–rich diet. Unfortunately, neural tube birth defects can occur just a few weeks after conception, when many women are still unaware that they are pregnant—especially if the pregnancy is unplanned.</p>

In severe instances, the baby is born with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), estimated to occur in 0.2 to 1.5 of every 1,000 live births in the United States. Children with FAS are frequently underweight and have an abnormally small head, abnormal facial development, and intellectual disabilities. As they mature, children with FAS often exhibit a short attention span, impulsiveness, and poor judgment, as well as problems with learning and memory. Heavy alcohol use also reduces a woman’s folic acid level, increasing the risk of neural tube defects.</p>

By the fifth week of fetal development, the heart has formed; it is too small to hear but it can be seen on an ultrasound. By week 10, the heart is fully developed and is beating at a rate of 150 to 195 beats per minute. The sounds of the heart at this point are often referred to as fetal heart tones (FHTs) and are very rapid due to the heart’s small size; however, eventually they will settle into a rate of 120 to 160 beats per minute (usually after the twelfth week) and may even beat in synch with the mother’s rate. The fetal heart can be heard through the end of the first trimester and into the beginning of the second using an amplification machine called a Doppler instrument, which bounces harmless sound waves off the heart. After that point, depending on the position of the fetus, a stethoscope can detect the heartbeat as the fetus and its heart get larger.</p>

As discussed later in this section, the presence of an <i>SRY</i> gene, usually on the Y chromosome, leads to the development of testes and male genitals. Otherwise, ovaries and female genitals develop. At this time, either testes or ovaries are located within the abdominal cavity. Later, in the last trimester of fetal development, the testes descend into the scrotal sacs (scrotum). Sometimes, the testes fail to descend. In that case, an operation may be done later to place them in their proper location.</p>

However, if the fetus does not turn, a breech birth (rump first) is likely. It is very difficult for the cervix to expand enough to accommodate this form of birth, and asphyxiation of the baby is more likely to occur. Thus, a <i>cesarean section</i> (incision through the abdominal and uterine walls) may be prescribed for delivery of the fetus.</p>

The <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-testosterone"><dfn title="testosterone">testosterone</dfn></a> produced by the testes stimulates the Wolffian ducts to become male genital ducts. The Wolffian ducts enter the urethra, which belongs to both the urinary and reproductive systems in males. An anti-Müllerian hormone causes the Müllerian ducts to regress. In the absence of an <i>SRY</i> gene, ovaries (rather than testes) develop from the same indifferent tissue. Now the Wolffian ducts regress, and because of an absence of testosterone, the Müllerian ducts develop into the uterus and uterine tubes. Estrogen has no effect on the Wolffian duct, which degenerates in females. A developing vagina also extends from the uterus. There is no connection between the urinary and genital systems in females.</p>

By 14 weeks, this groove has disappeared in males, and the scrotum has formed from the original swellings. In females, the groove persists and becomes the vaginal opening. Labia majora and labia minora are present instead of a scrotum.
