They had put off having children for several years while they pursued their careers. As they both approached the age of 40, they were beginning to feel the pressures of time. As a precautionary method, Amber had begun taking prenatal vitamins; additionally, she was much more aware of the content of her diet. Although neither of them was ever really into physical exercise, both began walking several times a week in preparation for what they hoped would be news that Amber was pregnant. Finally, after 2 months, Amber proudly announced that the home pregnancy test was positive! They immediately scheduled an appointment with their regular physician to prepare for the next stage of their lives.</p>
            <p id="data-uuid-4371eb5abff04a138add7a2e120e8fed" data-uuid="4371eb5abff04a138add7a2e120e8fed">Both Amber and Kent were very satisfied with their choice of a doctor. At the first visit following the positive results of the home pregnancy test, their physician performed a complete physical of Amber, as well as a blood test to confirm pregnancy. The physician informed the new parents that a blood test was much more accurate in detecting levels of the pregnancy hormone, human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), than over-the-counter (OTC) urine tests. The results of the blood test confirmed what Amber and Kent suspected, that in a period of just 40 weeks Amber and Kent would be parents.</p>

Amber was told to increase her level of exercise and watch her diet more closely. She needed to drink eight to ten glasses of water per day, as well as eat plenty of fruits and vegetables. The doctor informed them that it was crucial for Amber to inform her physician of any over-the-counter drugs she may want to take, especially in the first trimester. Her doctor told Amber that the first trimester was a period when critical organ systems developed in her baby and that most OTC medications and alcohol were now forbidden. Both Amber and Kent were up to the challenge and excited about the prospects of finally being parents.</p>
