As children, we become fascinated with life at a very early age. We want to know how our bodies work, why there are differences, and similarities, between ourselves and the other children around us. In other words, at a very early age, children are acting like biologists. </p>
        <p id="data-uuid-158b7b1c026e42228952acf2c3c408a0" data-uuid="158b7b1c026e42228952acf2c3c408a0">In many ways, today’s students in the science classroom face some of the same challenges their parents did decades ago. The abundance of new terms often overwhelms even the best prepared student, and the study of biological processes and methods of scientific thinking may convince some students that “science isn’t their thing.” The study of human biology creates an opportunity for teachers to instruct their students using the ultimate model organism—their own bodies. Whether this is their last science class or the first in a long career in allied health, the study of human biology is pertinent to everyone.</p>

Today’s students are are being exposed, almost on a daily basis, to exciting new discoveries and insights that, in many cases, were beyond our predictions even a few short years ago. It is our task, as instructors, not only to make these findings available to our students, but to enlighten students as to why these discoveries are important to their lives and society. At the same time, we must provide students with a firm foundation in those core principles on which biology is founded, and in doing so, provide them with the background to keep up with the many discoveries still to come. </p>

The premise is very straightforward. Students don’t know what they don’t know—but LearnSmart does. By compiling data from all of the probes answered by all of the students, and then overlaying that data on the text, we are able to visualize areas of content where the students are having problems.</p>

In addition, McGraw-Hill’s collection of 3D animations are integrated into the more difficult chapters of the text.</p>
