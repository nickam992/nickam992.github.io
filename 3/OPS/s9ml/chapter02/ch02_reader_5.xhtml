A special class of unsaturated fatty acids, the omega-3 fatty acids, is considered both an essential and a developmentally important nutrient. The name <i>omega-3</i> (also called <i>n-3 fatty acids</i>) is derived from the location of the double bond in the carbon chain.</p>

Omega-3 fatty acids are a major component of the fatty acids in the brain, and adequate amounts of them appear to be important in children and young adults. A diet that is rich in these fatty acids also offers protection against cardiovascular disease, and research is ongoing with regard to other health benefits. DHA may reduce the risk of Alzheimer disease. DHA and EPA may be manufactured from APA in small amounts within our bodies. Some of the best sources of omega-3 fatty acids are cold-water fish, such as salmon and sardines. Flax oil, also called <i>linseed oil,</i> is an excellent plant-based source of omega-3 fatty acids.</p>

Such kinks prevent close packing between the hydrocarbon chains and account for the fluidity of oils. On the other hand, butter, which contains saturated fatty acids and no double bonds, is a solid at room temperature.</p>
<p id="data-uuid-d7b73a68a8ba4388b5876553b1581934" data-uuid="d7b73a68a8ba4388b5876553b1581934">Saturated fats, in particular, contribute to the disease <i>atherosclerosis.</i> Atherosclerosis is caused by the formation of lesions, or <i>atherosclerotic plaques,</i> on the inside of blood vessels. The plaques narrow blood vessel diameter, choking off the blood and oxygen supply to tissues. Atherosclerosis is the primary cause of cardiovascular disease (heart attack and stroke) in the United States. Even more harmful than naturally occurring saturated fats are the <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-trans-fat"><dfn title="trans fat">trans fats</dfn></a> (<i>trans</i> in Latin means “across”) (<a href="ch02_reader_5.xhtml#data-uuid-5bb94aa4c7d4418a90408e6feb348072" class="link-inline">Fig. 2.17</a>), which are created artificially from vegetable oils. Trans fats may be partially hydrogenated to make them semisolid. Complete hydrogenation of oils causes all double bonds to become saturated. Partial hydrogenation does not saturate all bonds. It reconfigures some double bonds, but some of the hydrogen atoms end up on different sides of the chain. This configuration makes these bonds difficult to break, thus allowing trans fats to accumulate in the circulatory system. Trans fats are found in shortenings, solid margarines, and many processed foods (snack foods, baked goods, and fried foods).</p>

In particular, monounsaturated oils (such as olive oil, with one double bond in the carbon chain) are recommended. Polyunsaturated oils (many double bonds in the carbon chain), such as corn oil, canola oil, and safflower oil, also fit in the AHA guidelines.</p>

After your annual exam, your doctor tells you that your total cholesterol is 210, your HDL value is low (34), and your LDL value is high (110). You know that you need to get your total cholesterol below 200, the threshold of a healthy diet; but like most people, you have no idea what the other two numbers mean. Then you remember that LDL is commonly referred to as “bad” cholesterol, and HDL is called the “good” cholesterol. In actuality, these molecules are not forms of cholesterol; they are types of proteins. The lipoproteins in the body serve as a form of fat and cholesterol carrier, moving these nutrients around as needed. An LDL is a lipoprotein that is full of triglycerides and cholesterol, whereas an HDL is basically empty. Thus, a high LDL value indicates that your carriers are usually full, meaning that your diet must be providing too many of these nutrients. After additional research, you find out that other factors, such as the amount of dietary fiber, daily exercise, and even genetics, can play a role in regulating “good” and “bad” levels of these lipoproteins. Furthermore, the numbers that the doctor gave you were actually concentrations of these molecules in your blood (in milligrams per deciliter, or mg/dl). In today’s world, it is important that we all understand the terminology associated with our own medical history.</p>

Steroid molecules have a backbone of four fused carbon rings. Each one differs primarily by the molecules, called <i>functional groups,</i> attached to the rings. Cholesterol is a component of an animal cell’s plasma membrane and is the precursor of several other steroids, such as the sex hormones estrogen and testosterone. The liver usually makes all the cholesterol the body needs. Dietary sources should be restricted, because elevated levels of cholesterol, saturated fats, and trans fats are linked to atherosclerosis.</p>

Testosterone and estrogen differ only by the functional groups attached to the same carbon backbone. However, they have a profound effect on the body and the sexuality of humans and other animals (<a href="ch02_reader_5.xhtml#data-uuid-9cf742443f904144b4c80633d555f244" class="link-inline">Fig. 2.20</a>).
