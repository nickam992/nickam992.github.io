For example, as previously mentioned, the <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-prosimian"><dfn title="prosimian">prosimians</dfn></a> now include the lemurs, tarsiers, and lorises; the <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-anthropoid"><dfn title="anthropoid">anthropoids</dfn></a> include the monkeys, apes, and humans.

On the contrary, humans and apes are thought to have shared a common apelike ancestor. Today’s apes are our distant cousins, and we couldn’t have evolved from our cousins, because we are contemporaries—living on Earth at the same time. Humans and apes have been evolving separately from a common ancestor for about 7 million years. Following the split between humans and apes, different environments selected for the different traits that apes and humans have now.</p>

These features include <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-bipedal-posture"><dfn title="bipedal posture">bipedal posture</dfn></a> (walking on two feet), the shape of the face, and brain size. Today’s humans have a flatter face and a more pronounced chin than do the apes, because the human jaw is shorter than that of the apes. Then, too, our teeth are generally smaller and less specialized. We don’t have the sharp canines of an ape, for example. Chimpanzees have a brain size of about 400 cubic centimeters (cc), and modern humans have a brain size of about 1,360 cc.</p>
        <p id="data-uuid-360c665709654866961aaaebb951f4a8" data-uuid="360c665709654866961aaaebb951f4a8">It’s hard to decide which fossils are hominins, because human features evolved gradually and at different rates.

The oldest of these fossils, called <i>Sahelanthropus tchadensis</i><i>,</i> dated at 7 <small>mya</small>, was found in Chad, in central Africa, far from eastern and southern Africa, where other hominid fossils were excavated. The only find, a skull, appears to be that of a hominin, because it has smaller canines and thicker tooth enamel than an ape. The braincase, however, is very apelike. It is impossible to tell if this hominin walked upright. Some suggest this fossil is ancestral to the gorilla.</p>
        <p id="data-uuid-fb3b4d36e51a40edae913f1656079f2b" data-uuid="fb3b4d36e51a40edae913f1656079f2b"><i>Orrorin tugenensis,</i> dated at 6 <small>mya</small> and found in eastern Africa, is thought to be another early hominin, especially because the limb anatomy suggests a bipedal posture. However, the canine teeth are large and pointed, and the arm and finger bones retain adaptations for climbing. Some suggest this fossil is ancestral to the chimpanzee.</p>
        <p id="data-uuid-ccbb9272e5c64b4aaf3349af55357e91" data-uuid="ccbb9272e5c64b4aaf3349af55357e91">Two species of <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-ardipithicines"><dfn title="ardipithicines">ardipithecines</dfn></a> have been uncovered, <i>Ardipithecus kadabba</i> and<i> A. ramidus.</i> Only teeth and a few bone bits have been found for <i>A. kadabba,</i> and these have been dated to around 5.6 <small>mya</small>. A more extensive collection of fossils has been collected for <i>A. ramidus.</i> To date, over 100 skeletons, all dated to 4.4 <small>mya</small>, have been identified from this species; all were collected near a small town in Ethiopia, East Africa. These fossils have been reconstructed to form a female fossil specimen, affectionately called Ardi.</p>
        <p id="data-uuid-fb1afe241b424cc4b31edcb5c69a59a3" data-uuid="fb1afe241b424cc4b31edcb5c69a59a3">Some of Ardi’s features are primitive, like that of an ape, but others are like that of a human. Ardi was about the size of a chimpanzee, standing about 120 cm (4 ft) tall and weighing about 55 kg (110 lb). It appears that males and females were about the same size.</p>
        <p id="data-uuid-6f0e6c39faa5488d94b35a4eb2f2d008" data-uuid="6f0e6c39faa5488d94b35a4eb2f2d008">Ardi had a small head compared to the size of her body. The skull had the same features as <i>Sahelanthropus tchadensis</i> but was smaller. Ardi’s brain size was around 300 to 350 cc, slightly less than that of a chimpanzee brain (around 400 cc), and much smaller than that of a modern human (1,360 cc). The muzzle (area of the nose and mouth) projects forward, and the forehead is low with heavy eyebrow ridges, a combination that makes the face more primitive than that of the australopithecines (discussed next). However, the projection of the face is less than that of a chimpanzee, because Ardi’s teeth were small and like those of an omnivore. She lacked the strong, sharp canines of a chimpanzee, and her diet probably consisted mostly of soft, rather than tough, plant material.</p>
        <p id="data-uuid-c67b32bd35b749f09a4aff793bf8b2bb" data-uuid="c67b32bd35b749f09a4aff793bf8b2bb">Ardi could walk erect, but she spent a lot of time in trees. Ardi’s feet had a bone, missing in apes, that kept her feet squarely on the ground, a sure sign that she was bipedal and not a quadruped like the apes. Nevertheless, like the apes, she had an opposable big toe. Opposable toes allow an animal’s feet to grab hold of a tree limb. The wrists of Ardi’s hands were flexible, and most likely she moved along tree limbs on all fours, as ancient apes did. Modern apes brachiate—use their arms to swing from limb to limb. Ardi did not do this, but her shoulders were flexible enough to allow her to reach for limbs to the side or over her head. The general conclusion is that Ardi moved carefully in trees. Although the top of her pelvis was like that of a human, and probably served as the attachment for muscles needed for walking, the bottom of the pelvis served as an attachment for the strong muscles needed for climbing trees.</p>
        <p id="data-uuid-2e8b152a5af3460881e08ffa9ed62b21" data-uuid="2e8b152a5af3460881e08ffa9ed62b21">Until recently, it was suggested that bipedalism evolved when a dramatic change in climate caused the forests of East Africa to be replaced by grassland. However, evidence suggests that Ardi lived in the woods, which questions the advantage that walking erect would have afforded her. Bipedalism does provide an advantage in caring for a helpless infant by allowing it to be carried by hand from one location to another. It is also possible that bipedalism benefited the males of the species as they foraged for food on the floor of the forests. More evidence is needed to better understand this mystery, but one thing is clear—the ardipithecines represent a link between our quadruped ancestors and the bipedal hominins.</p>

Recent changes in the classification of these groups has separated the gracile types into genus <i>Australopithecus</i> and the robust types into the genus <i>Paranthropus</i>.  The genus <i>Australopithecus</i> gave rise to genus <i>Homo</i>.</p>

This hominin, named <i>Australopithecus africanus,</i> dates to about 2.9 <small>mya </small> and had a brain size of about 500 cc. Limb anatomy suggests these hominids walked upright. However, the proportions of the limbs were apelike. The forelimbs were longer than the hindlimbs.

Nine skeletons were discovered in a cave on Flores, an Indonesian island east of Bali, midway between Asia and Australia. This new species of humans grew no taller than a modern 3-year-old child (<a href="ch23_reader_4.xhtml#data-uuid-e4bd111356804cfca03bd782ceea2dec" class="link-inline">Fig. 23A</a>). One skeleton was that of an adult female who died when she was approximately 30 years old. She stood 1 m tall (3.3 ft) and weighed approximately 25 kg (55 lb). Scientists estimate that she died around 18,000 years ago.</p>

They named the species <i>Homo floresiensis</i> after the island where it was found. The workers at the excavation site nicknamed the tiny creatures “hobbits” after the fictional creatures in the <i>Lord of the Rings</i> books by J. R. R. Tolkien.</p>

The teeth were humanlike, the eyebrow ridges were thick, the forehead sloped sharply, and the face lacked a chin. Even though the hobbits stood only 3 ft tall, they are not classified as pygmies. Despite the small body size, the small brain size, and a mixture of primitive and advanced anatomical features, <i>H. floresiensis</i> is distinctly a member of genus <i>Homo.</i> The researchers believe that <i>Homo floresiensis</i> possibly evolved from a population of <i>H. erectus</i> that reached Flores approximately 840,000 years ago.</p>

Archaeological evidence indicates that <i>H. floresiensis</i> had the use of fire. The skeletons discovered on Flores were found in sediment deposits that also contained stone tools and the bones of dwarf elephants, giant rodents, and Komodo dragons. The dwarf elephants, or stegodons, weighed about 1,000 kg (2,200 lb) and would have posed a serious challenge to men who were only 1 m tall. Successful hunting would have required communication among members of the hunting party. The Flores diet also included fish, frogs, birds, rodents, snakes, and tortoises.</p>

And yet their brain was about one-third the size of modern humans. <i>Homo floresiensis</i> is the smallest species of human ever discovered. </p>

The first-discovered skeleton was believed to be that of a small child. There is no evidence of any other 1-m-tall adults in genus <i>Homo.</i> Modern pygmies are 1.4 to 1.5 m (4.6 to nearly 5 ft) tall. Over thousands of years, it is possible that a population of <i>Homo erectus</i> evolved into <i>H. floresiensis.</i> If so, a smaller body size would have been favored by natural selection. The members of each generation could have been smaller than the previous generation. Dwarfing of mammals on islands is a well-known process worldwide. Islands generally have a limited food supply, few predators, and at least a few species competing for the same ecological niche. It behooves species living on islands to minimize their daily energy requirements. The smaller the body size, the fewer the calories per day required for survival. Another hypothesis, presented in 2014, suggests that the skeletons of <i>H. floresiensis</i> actually represent a population of <i>Homo sapiens</i> with Down syndrome. Further research is needed to identify the true origins and evolution of <i>H. floresiensis</i>.</p>

Researchers found <i>H. floresiensis</i> and pygmy stegodon remains below a 12,000-year-old volcanic ash layer. Hobbits reached the island approximately 11,000 years ago and possibly intermingled with modern humans. Rumors, myths, and legends among the indigenous tribes of Flores about “the tiny people who lived in the forest” have persisted.</p>
