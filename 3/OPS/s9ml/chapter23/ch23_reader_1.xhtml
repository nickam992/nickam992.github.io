Living organisms acquire energy through metabolism, or the chemical reactions that occur within cells. Living organisms also respond and interact with their environment, self-replicate, and are subject to the forces of natural selection that drive adaptation to the environment. The molecules of life, called <i>biomolecules,</i> are organic molecules. The first living organisms on Earth would have had all these characteristics, yet early Earth was very different from the Earth we know today, consisting mainly of inorganic substances.

This may have produced small organic compounds, such as nucleotides and amino acids (Stage 1 of <a href="ch23_reader_1.xhtml#data-uuid-3823d7e73f5f4ad7823de29da01cb5bc" class="link-inline">Fig. 23.1</a>).

To simulate the Earth’s early environment, Miller placed the inorganic materials believed to have been present on the early Earth in a closed system, heated it, and circulated it past an electrical spark. After a week, the solution contained a variety of amino acids and organic compounds. This and other similar experiments support the hypothesis that inorganic chemicals can form organic molecules in the presence of a strong energy source, even if oxygen is not present.</p>

Researchers have proposed that thermal vents at the bottom of the Earth’s oceans provided all the elements and conditions necessary to synthesize organic monomers. According to one of these hypotheses, dissolved gases emitted from thermal vents, such as carbon monoxide (CO), ammonia, and hydrogen sulfide, pass over iron and nickel sulfide minerals, also present at thermal vents. The iron and nickel sulfide molecules act as catalysts that drive the chemical evolution from inorganic to organic molecules.</p>

Comets and meteorites have constantly pelted the Earth throughout history. In recent years, scientists have confirmed the presence of organic molecules in some meteorites. Some scientists feel that these organic molecules could have seeded the chemical origin of life on early Earth. Others even hypothesize that bacterium-like cells evolved first on another planet and then were carried to Earth. A meteorite from Mars labeled ALH84001 landed on Earth some 13,000 years ago. When examined, experts found tiny rods similar in shape to fossilized bacteria. This hypothesis continues to be investigated.</p>

There are two hypotheses of special interest concerning this stage in the origin of life. One is the <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-RNA-first-hypothesis"><dfn title="RNA-first hypothesis">RNA-first hypothesis</dfn></a><b>.</b> This suggests that only the macromolecule RNA was needed at this time to progress toward formation of the first cell or cells. This hypothesis was formulated after the discovery that RNA can sometimes be both a substrate and an enzyme during RNA processing (see <a href="../chapter22/ch22_reader_2.xhtml#data-uuid-08c034203f1343be9527a0c4338f56b4" class="link-inline">section 22.2</a>). At that time, the splicing of mRNA to remove introns was done by a complex composed of both RNA and protein. The RNA, not the protein, is the enzyme. RNA enzymes are called <i>ribozymes.</i> Then, too, ribosomes where protein synthesis occurs contain rRNA. Perhaps RNA, then, could have carried out the processes of life commonly associated with DNA and proteins. Scientists who support this hypothesis are fond of saying that it was an “RNA world” some 3.5 <small>bya</small>. However, DNA, being a double helix, is more stable than RNA. In the RNA-first hypothesis, RNA would have served as the first genetic material, with a transition to DNA occurring later. As far as we know, all organisms on the planet use DNA as their genetic material, but scientists continue to look for evidence to support the RNA-first hypothesis.</p>

He suggested that amino acids collected in shallow puddles along the rocky shore. The heat of the sun caused them to form proteinoids, small polypeptides that have some catalytic properties. When proteinoids are returned to water, they form microspheres. Microspheres are structures composed only of protein that have many of the properties of a cell.</p>

Scientists who support the RNA-first hypothesis propose a series of steps. According to this hypothesis, the first cell had RNA genes that, like messenger RNA, could have specified protein synthesis. Some of the proteins formed would have been enzymes. Perhaps one of these enzymes, such as reverse transcriptase found in retroviruses, could use RNA as a template to form DNA. Replication of DNA then would have proceeded normally.</p>

Then, DNA would have gone on to specify protein synthesis; in this way, the cell could have acquired all of its enzymes, even the ones that replicated DNA.</p>

Therefore, the first true cell would have contained RNA genes that could have replicated because of the presence of proteins. This eliminates the baffling chicken-and-egg paradox: Assuming a plasma membrane, which came first, proteins or RNA? It means, however, that two unlikely events would have had to happen at the same time.</p>

The present genetic code is subject to fewer errors than a million other possible codes. Also, the present code is among the best at minimizing the effect of mutations. A single-base change in a present codon is likely to result in the substitution of a chemically similar amino acid and, therefore, minimal changes in the final protein. This evidence suggests that the genetic code, like all other cellular processes, underwent natural selection before finalizing into today’s code.</p>
