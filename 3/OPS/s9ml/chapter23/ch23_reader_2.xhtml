Later, <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-eukaryotic-cell"><dfn title="eukaryotic cell">eukaryotic cells</dfn></a> (the protists), which have nuclei, evolved. Then, multicellularity and the other kingdoms (fungi, plants, and animals) evolved (see <a href="../chapter01/ch01_reader_2.xhtml#data-uuid-4a071c4162a74e5da135c43e4a5db173" class="link-inline">Fig. 1.5</a>). Evidence suggests that all life on Earth has an evolutionary history and has undergone biological evolution, or change over time. Biological evolution has two important aspects: descent from a common ancestor and adaptation to the environment. Descent from the original cell or cells explains why all life has a common chemistry and a cellular structure. An <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-adaptation"><dfn title="adaptation">adaptation</dfn></a> is a characteristic that makes an organism able to survive and reproduce in its environment.

Darwin’s most significant contribution was to describe a mechanism for adaptation—natural selection. During adaptation, a species becomes suited to its environment. On his trip, Darwin visited the Galápagos Islands. He saw a number of finches that resembled one another but had different ways of life. Some were seed-eating ground finches, some cactus-eating ground finches, and some insect-eating tree finches. A warbler-type finch had a beak that could take honey from a flower. A woodpecker-type finch lacked the long tongue of a woodpecker but could use a cactus spine or twig to pull insects from cracks in the bark of a tree. Darwin thought the finches were all descended from a mainland ancestor whose offspring had spread out among the islands and had become adapted to different environments.</p>

It would not be possible to test in a scientific way whether an intelligent agent existed. If it were possible to structure such an experiment, scientists would be the first to do it.</p>

Lamarck’s explanation for the long neck of the giraffe was based on the assumption that the ancestors of the modern giraffe were trying to reach into the trees to browse on high-growing vegetation (<a href="ch23_reader_2.xhtml#data-uuid-18b15cbcb08d4de3a1c5763e993e6e05" class="link-inline">Fig. 23.3</a>). Continual stretching of the neck caused it to become longer, and this acquired characteristic was passed on to the next generation. Lamarck’s mechanism will not work, because acquired characteristics cannot be inherited (<a href="ch23_reader_2.xhtml#data-uuid-18b15cbcb08d4de3a1c5763e993e6e05" class="link-inline">Fig. 23.3</a>).</p>

For example, prehistoric humans probably noted desirable variations among wolves and selected particular individuals for breeding. Therefore, the desired traits increased in frequency in the next generation. The same process was repeated many times, resulting in today’s numerous varieties of dogs, all descended from the wolf. In a similar way, several varieties of vegetables can be traced to a single ancestor. Chinese cabbage, brussels sprouts, and kohlrabi are all derived from a single species, <i>Brassica oleracea.</i></p>

Analysis of canine DNA indicates that dogs (<i>Canis familiaris</i>) are a direct descendant of the gray wolf (<i>Canis lupus</i>). This domestication, and the subsequent selection for desirable traits, appears to have begun over 130,000 years ago. Artificial selection of dogs continues to this day, with over 150 variations (breeds) currently known.</p>

They are the actual remains of species that lived on Earth at least 10,000 years ago and up to billions of years ago. Fossils can be the traces of past life or any other direct evidence that past life existed. Traces include trails, footprints, burrows, worm casts, and even preserved droppings. Fossils can also be such items as pieces of bone, impressions of plants pressed into shale, and insects trapped in tree resin (which we know as amber). Most fossils, however, are found embedded in or recently eroded from sedimentary rock. Sedimentation, a process that has been going on since the Earth was formed, can take place on land or in bodies of water. Weathering and erosion of rocks produce an accumulation of particles. These particles vary in size and nature and are called sediment. Sediment becomes a stratum (pl., strata), a recognizable layer in a sequence of layers. Any given stratum is older than the one above it and younger than the one immediately below it. This allows fossils to be dated.</p>
        <p id="data-uuid-a22b90c12f2e420680e9a9b68235e105" data-uuid="a22b90c12f2e420680e9a9b68235e105">Usually, when an organism dies, the soft parts are either consumed by scavengers or decomposed by bacteria. This means that most fossils consist only of hard parts, such as shells, bones, or teeth. These are usually not consumed or destroyed. When a fossil is found encased by rock, the remains were first buried in sediment. The hard parts were preserved by a process called mineralization. Finally, the surrounding sediment hardened to form rock. Subsequently, the fossil has to be found by a human. Most estimates suggest that less than 1% of past species have been preserved as fossils. Only a small fraction of these have been found.</p>

Usually, paleontologists remove fossils from the strata to study them in the laboratory. Then they may decide to exhibit them. The <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-fossil-record"><dfn title="fossil record">fossil record</dfn></a> is the history of life recorded by fossils. <i>Paleontology</i> is the science of discovering the fossil record. Decisions about the history of life, ancient climates, and environments can be made using the fossil record. The fossil record is the most direct evidence we have that evolution has occurred. The species found in ancient sedimentary rock are not the species we see today.</p>

Today, we have a far more complete record than was available to Darwin. The record is complete enough to tell us that, in general, life has progressed from the simple to the complex. Single-celled prokaryotes are the first signs of life in the fossil record. Single-celled eukaryotes and then multicellular eukaryotes followed. Among the latter, fishes evolved before terrestrial plants and animals. On land, nonflowering plants preceded the flowering plants. Amphibians preceded the reptiles, including the dinosaurs. Dinosaurs are directly linked to the birds, but they are only indirectly linked to the evolution of mammals, including humans.</p>

In particular, they tell us who is related to whom and how evolution occurred. In 2004, a team of paleontologists discovered fossilized remains of <i>Tiktaalik roseae,</i> nicknamed the “fishapod” because it is the transitional form between fish and four-legged animals, the tetrapods (<a href="ch23_reader_2.xhtml#data-uuid-9f4789c0d5474049a5ab1578cbf86c42" class="link-inline">Fig. 23.4</a>). <i>Tiktaalik</i> fossils are estimated to be 375 million years old and are from a time when the transition from fish to tetrapods is likely to have occurred. As expected of an intermediate fossil, <i>Tiktaalik</i> has a mix of fishlike and tetrapod-like features that illustrate the steps in the evolution of tetrapods from a fishlike ancestor (<a href="ch23_reader_2.xhtml#data-uuid-9f4789c0d5474049a5ab1578cbf86c42" class="link-inline">Fig. 23.4</a>). For example, <i>Tiktaalik</i> has a very fishlike set of gills and fins, with the exception of the pectoral (front) fins, which have the beginnings of wrist bones similar to a tetrapod. Unlike a fish, <i>Tiktaalik</i> has a flat head, a flexible neck, eyes on the top of its head like a crocodile, and interlocking ribs that suggest it had lungs. These transitional features suggest that it had the ability to push itself along the bottom of shallow rivers and see above the surface of the water—features that would have come in handy in the river habitat where it lived.</p>

The dinosaur-like skeleton of these fossils had reptilian features, including jaws with teeth, and a long, jointed tail. But <i>Archaeopteryx</i> also had feathers and wings. <a href="ch23_reader_2.xhtml#data-uuid-63f9546ca3964d37862eb8f596218c2d" class="link-inline">Figure 23.5</a> not only shows a fossil of <i>Archaeopteryx</i> but also gives us an artist’s representation of the animal based on the fossil remains. Another example of how transitional fossils can be used to trace the evolutionary history of an organism is the whale. It had always been thought that whales had terrestrial ancestors. Now, fossils have been discovered that support this hypothesis (<a href="ch23_reader_2.xhtml#data-uuid-318f232c70764f9ab582e632c4377f9d" class="link-inline">Fig. 23.6</a>). <i>Ambulocetus natans</i> (“the walking whale that swims”) was the size of a large sea lion, with broad, webbed feet on both fore- and hindlimbs. This animal could both walk and swim. It also had tiny hooves on its toes and the primitive skull and teeth of early whales. It is believed that <i>Ambulocetus</i> was a predator that patrolled freshwater streams, looking for prey.</p>

The synapsids are mammal-like reptiles whose descendants were wolflike and bearlike predators, as well as several types of piglike herbivores. Slowly, mammalian-like fossils acquired features, such as a palate, that would have enabled them to breathe and eat at the same time. They also acquired a muscular diaphragm and rib cage that would have helped them breathe efficiently. The earliest true mammals were shrew-size creatures found in fossil beds about 200 million years old.</p>

Such distributions are consistent with the hypothesis that life-forms evolved in a particular locale before they spread out. Therefore, you would expect a different mix of plants and animals whenever geography separates continents, islands, or seas. For example, Darwin noted that South America lacks a diversity of rabbits, even though the environment was suitable for them. He concluded that few rabbits lived in South America because rabbits evolved somewhere else and had no means of reaching South America. Instead, the Patagonian hare lives in South America. The Patagonian hare resembles a rabbit in anatomy and behavior, but it has the face of a guinea pig, from which it probably evolved.</p>

Why do so many species of finches live on the Galápagos Islands, when the same species are not on the mainland? The reasonable explanation is that finches from the ancestral species migrated to all the different islands. Then, geographic isolation allowed the ancestral finches to evolve into a different species on each island.</p>

Marsupials (pouched mammals) arose at this time and today are found in both South America and Australia. But when Australia separated and drifted away, the marsupials diversified into many different forms suited to various environments of Australia (<a href="ch23_reader_2.xhtml#data-uuid-a78853f9638e4c73ab8bf2fedb5630ef" class="link-inline">Fig. 23.7</a>). They were free to do so because there were few, if any, placental mammals in Australia. In South America, where there are placental mammals, marsupials are not as diverse. This supports the hypothesis that evolution is influenced by the mix of plants and animals in a particular continent—by biogeography.</p>

Vertebrate forelimbs are used for flight (birds and bats), orientation during swimming (whales and seals), running (horses), climbing (arboreal lizards), or swinging from tree branches (monkeys). However, all vertebrate forelimbs contain the same sets of bones organized in similar ways, despite their dissimilar functions (<a href="ch23_reader_2.xhtml#data-uuid-5bd5d81f7ae841d99018583c2bf3d7fc" class="link-inline">Fig. 23.8</a>). The most plausible explanation for this unity is that the basic forelimb plan belonged to a common ancestor. The basic plan was then modified in the succeeding groups as each continued along its own evolutionary pathway. Structures that are anatomically similar because they are inherited from a common ancestor are called <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-homologous-structure"><dfn title="homologous structure">homologous structures</dfn></a><b>.</b> In contrast, <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-analogous-structure"><dfn title="analogous structure">analogous structures</dfn></a> serve the same function but are not constructed similarly; nor do they share a common ancestry. The wings of birds and insects are analogous structures, as are the jointed appendages of a lobster and a human. The presence of homology, not analogy, is evidence that organisms are related.</p>

Modern whales have a vestigial pelvic girdle and legs. The ancestors of whales walked on land, but whales are totally aquatic animals today. Most birds have well-developed wings used for flight. Some bird species (e.g., ostrich), however, have greatly reduced wings and do not fly. Similarly, snakes have no use for hindlimbs, yet some have remnants of a pelvic girdle and legs. Humans have a tailbone but no tail. The presence of vestigial structures can be explained by common descent: Vestigial structures occur because organisms inherit their anatomy from their ancestors. They are traces of an organism’s evolutionary history.</p>

At some time during development, all vertebrates have a postanal tail and exhibit paired pharyngeal pouches. In fish and amphibian larvae, these pouches develop into functioning gills. In humans, the first pair of pouches becomes the cavity of the middle ear and the auditory tube. The second pair becomes the tonsils. The third and fourth pairs become the thymus and parathyroid glands, respectively. Why should terrestrial vertebrates develop and then modify structures, like pharyngeal pouches, that have lost their original function? The most likely explanation is that fish are ancestral to other vertebrate groups.</p>

Evolutionists who study development have also found that many developmental genes (called <i>Hox</i> genes) are shared in animals ranging from worms to humans.
