For our purposes, we will focus on the more traditional classification of the members of our genus.</p>

Some of these fossils have a brain size as large as 775 cc, about 45% larger than that of <i>A. afarensis.</i> The cheek teeth are smaller than even those of the gracile australopithecines. Therefore, it is likely that these early members of the genus <i>Homo</i> were omnivores who ate meat in addition to plant material. Bones at their campsites bear cut marks, indicating that they used tools to strip them of meat.</p>

If so, both hunters and gatherers most likely ate together and shared their food. In this way, society and culture could have begun.</p>

The nose projected, however. This type of nose is adaptive for a hot, dry climate, because it permits water to be removed before air leaves the body. The recovery of an almost complete skeleton of a 10-year-old boy indicates that <i>H. ergaster</i> was much taller than the hominids discussed thus far. Males were 1.8 m tall (about 6 ft), and females were 1.55 m (approaching 5 ft). Indeed, these hominids were erect and most likely had a striding gait like ours. The robust and most likely heavily muscled skeleton still retained some australopithecine features. Even so, the size of the birth canal indicates that infants were born in an immature state that required an extended period of care.</p>

At one time, the migration was thought to have occurred about 1 <small>mya</small>. Recently, <i>H. erectus</i> fossil remains in Java and the Republic of Georgia have been dated at 1.9 and 1.6 <small>mya</small>, respectively. These remains push the evolution of <i>H. erectus</i> in Africa to an earlier date than has yet been determined. In any case, such an extensive population movement is a first in the history of humankind and a tribute to the intellectual and physical skills of the species.</p>

Flake tools were probably used for cutting and scraping. It could be that <i>H. ergaster</i> was a systematic hunter and brought kills to the same site over and over. In one location, researchers have found over 40,000 bones and 2,647 stones. These sites could have been “home bases,” where social interaction occurred and a prolonged childhood allowed time for learning. Perhaps a language evolved and a culture more like our own developed.</p>

The Neandertals had massive brow ridges; and their nose, jaws, and teeth protruded far forward. The forehead was low and sloping, and the lower jaw lacked a chin. New fossils show that the pubic bone was long compared with ours.</p>
        <p id="data-uuid-80a0cc92004249a48a38a5fdff457bfe" data-uuid="80a0cc92004249a48a38a5fdff457bfe">According to the replacement model, Neandertals were eventually supplanted by modern humans. However, this traditional view is being challenged by studies of the Neandertal genome (completed in 2010), which suggests that not only did Neandertals interbreed with <i>Homo sapiens</i> but between 1 and 4% of the genomes of non-African <i>Homo sapiens</i> contain remnants of the Neandertal genome. Some scientists are suggesting that Neandertals were not a separate species but simply a race of <i>Homo sapiens</i> that was eventually absorbed into the larger population. Research continues into these and other hypotheses that explain these similarities.</p>
        <p id="data-uuid-38ba8cbca9cb47d4a86569e375d6fbbf" data-uuid="38ba8cbca9cb47d4a86569e375d6fbbf">Physiologically, the Neandertal brain was, on the average, slightly larger than that of <i>H. sapiens</i> (1,400 cc, compared with 1,360 cc in most modern humans). The Neandertals were heavily muscled, especially in the shoulders and neck. The bones of the limbs were shorter and thicker than those of modern humans. It is hypothesized that a larger brain than that of modern humans was required to control the extra musculature. The Neandertals lived in Europe and Asia during the last Ice Age, and their sturdy build could have helped conserve heat.</p>
        <p id="data-uuid-dddd1b1d89c8499ebd53bde755c41ad4" data-uuid="dddd1b1d89c8499ebd53bde755c41ad4">The Neandertals give evidence of being culturally advanced. Most lived in caves, but those living in the open may have built houses. They manufactured a variety of stone tools, including spear points, which could have been used for hunting. Scrapers and knives could have helped in food preparation. They most likely successfully hunted bears, woolly mammoths, rhinoceroses, reindeer, and other contemporary animals. They used and could control fire, which probably helped them cook meat and keep themselves warm. They even buried their dead with flowers and tools and may have had a religion. Perhaps they believed in life after death. If so, they were capable of thinking symbolically.</p>

Initially, scientists thought that this might be the remains of a species of early <i>Homo,</i> possibly related to <i>Homo erectus.</i> However, mitochondrial DNA studies indicated that the fossil belonged to a species that existed around 1 million years ago, around the same time as Neandertals. The analyses suggest that the <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-Denisovans"><dfn title="Denisovans">Denisovans</dfn></a> and Neandertals shared a common ancestor but did not interbreed with one another, possibly because of their geographic locations. However, what is interesting is the fact that <i>Homo sapiens</i> in the Oceania region (New Guinea and nearby islands) share around 5% of their genomes with the Denisovans. In 2014, researchers reported that an allele that allows for high-elevation living in Tibetans originated with the Denisovans.  When coupled with the Neandertal data, this suggests that modern <i>Homo sapiens</i> did not simply replace groups of early <i>Homo</i> species but, rather, may have assimilated them by inbreeding. Scientists are just beginning to unravel the implications of these Denisovan discoveries.</p>

Scientists recognize that Cro-Magnons were the modern humans who entered Asia and Europe from Africa around 100,000 years ago (or even earlier). Cro-Magnons had a thoroughly modern appearance (<a href="ch23_reader_5.xhtml#data-uuid-603b37b53a2240cd813bed39d3823ff9" class="link-inline">Fig. 23.20</a>). Analysis of Neandertal DNA indicates that it is so different from Cro-Magnon DNA that these two groups of people did not interbreed. Instead, Cro-Magnons seem to have replaced the Neandertals in the Middle East and then spread to Europe 40,000 years ago. There, they lived side by side with the Neandertals for several thousand years. If so, the Neandertals are cousins, not ancestors, to us.</p>

They may have been the first to make knifelike blades and throw spears, enabling them to kill animals from a distance. They were such accomplished hunters that some researchers suggest they were responsible for the extinction of many larger mammals, such as the giant sloth, mammoth, saber-toothed tiger, and giant ox, during the late Pleistocene epoch.</p>

Most likely, they lived in small groups, with the men hunting by day while the women remained at home with the children. It’s possible that this hunting way of life among prehistoric people influences our behavior today. The Cro-Magnon culture included art. They sculpted small figurines out of reindeer bones and antlers. They also painted beautiful drawings of animals on cave walls in Spain and France (<a href="ch23_reader_5.xhtml#data-uuid-603b37b53a2240cd813bed39d3823ff9" class="link-inline">Fig. 23.20</a>).</p>

It’s possible that the campsites for these species were home bases, where the women stayed with the children while the men went out to hunt. Hunting was an important event in the development of culture, especially because it encouraged the development of language. If <i>H. erectus</i> didn’t have the use of language, certainly Cro-Magnons did. People who have the ability to speak a language would have been able to cooperate better as they hunted and even as they sought places to gather plants. Among animals, only humans have a complex language that allows them to communicate their experiences. Words are not objects and events. They stand for objects and events that can be pictured in the mind.</p>

What accounts for the rise of agriculture? The answer is not known, but several explanations have been put forth. About 12,000 years ago, a warming trend occurred as the Ice Age came to a close. A variety of big-game animals became extinct, including the saber-toothed cats, mammoths, and mastodons. This may have made hunting less productive. As the weather warmed, the glaciers retreated and left fertile valleys, where rivers and streams were full of fish and the soil was good. The Fertile Crescent in Mesopotamia is one such example. Here, fishing villages may have sprung up, causing people to settle down.</p>

Most likely, as hunter-gatherers, people had already selected seeds with desirable characteristics for propagation. Then, a chance mutation may have made these plants particularly suitable as a source of food. They began to till the good soil where they had settled and to systematically plant crops (<a href="ch23_reader_5.xhtml#data-uuid-f02a968f352a46ed9dcc4391cb9abcb7" class="link-inline">Fig. 23B</a>).</p>

Population increases may have tipped the scales and caused them to adopt agriculture full-time, especially if agriculture could be counted on to provide food for hungry mouths. The availability of agricultural tools must have contributed to making agriculture worthwhile. The digging stick, the hoe, the sickle, and the plow were improved when iron tools replaced bronze in the stone-bronze-iron sequence of ancient tools. Irrigation began as a way to control water supply, especially in semiarid areas and regions of periodic rainfall.</p>

Also, agriculture ushered in civilization as we know it. When crops became bountiful, some people were freed from raising their own food. They began to specialize for other ways of life in towns and then cities. Some people became traders, shopkeepers, bakers, and teachers, to name a few possibilities. Others became the nobility, priests, and soldiers. Today, farming is highly mechanized and cities are extremely large. However, we are on a treadmill. As the human population increases, we need new innovations to produce greater amounts of food. As soon as food production increases, populations grow once again, and the demand for food becomes still greater. Will there be a point when the population is greater than the food capacity? Is that time already upon us?</p>

Our ability to construct any number of tools, including high-tech computers, is not stored in our genes. We learn it from the previous generation.

Species are becoming extinct unless they are able to adapt to the presence of our civilization. It could be that biocultural evolution will be so harmful to the biosphere that the human species also will eventually be driven to extinction.</p>

One obvious difference among people is skin color. A darker skin is protective against the high ultraviolet (UV) intensity of bright sunlight. On the other hand, a white skin ensures vitamin D production in the skin when the UV intensity is low. Harvard University geneticist Richard Lewontin points out, however, that this hypothesis concerning the survival value of dark and light skin has never been tested.</p>

The first, Bergmann’s rule, states that animals in colder regions of their range have a bulkier body build. The second, Allen’s rule, states that animals in colder regions of their range have shorter limbs, digits, and ears. Both of these effects help regulate body temperature by increasing the surface area-to-volume ratio in hot climates and decreasing the ratio in cold climates. For example, the Maasai of East Africa (<a href="ch23_reader_5.xhtml#data-uuid-53a110b1d2d84e46bca18b33d80c47c9" class="link-inline">Fig. 23.21<i>b</i></a>) tend to be very tall and slender, with elongated limbs. By contrast, the Eskimos, who live in northern regions, tend to have a more bulky build, with shorter limbs.</p>

Perhaps these features became fixed in different populations due to genetic drift. As far as intelligence is concerned, no significant disparities have been found among different ethnic groups.</p>

This hypothesis proposes that all modern humans have a relatively recent common ancestor (Cro-Magnon) who evolved in Africa and then spread into other regions. Paleontologists tell us that the variation among modern populations is considerably less than among human populations some 250,000 years ago. This would mean that all ethnic groups evolved from the same single, ancestral population.</p>

Lewontin, mentioned previously, found that the genotypes of different modern populations are extremely similar. He examined variations in 17 genes, including blood groups and various enzymes, among seven major geographic groups: Caucasians, black Africans, mongoloids, south Asian Aborigines, Amerinds, Oceanians, and Australian Aborigines. He found that the great majority of genetic variation—85%—occurs within ethnic groups, not among them. In other words, the amount of genetic variation between individuals of the same ethnic group is greater than the variation between ethnic groups.</p>

The comparison of the Neandertal and human genomes suggests that the two groups may have interbred long after they had diverged from their common ancestor. The Neandertal genome shares more commonality with modern humans from outside Africa than with modern African populations. Statistical studies have suggested that almost 4% of the genomes of modern Europeans may be Neandertal, suggesting that these two groups interbred freely in the past. If more samples support these findings, scientists agree that they may have to go back and revise some of their basic ideas of how modern humans evolved, and what our species’ interactions may have been with the other hominins.</p>
