        <p id="data-uuid-fdb1408c72c147258bacbeb8ee391c2c" data-uuid="fdb1408c72c147258bacbeb8ee391c2c">The nervous system is particularly able to respond to changes in the external environment. Some responses are automatic, as you can verify by trying this: Hold a piece of clear plastic in front of your face. Get someone to gently toss a soft object, such as a wadded-up piece of paper, at the plastic. Can you prevent yourself from blinking? This reflex protects your eyes.</p>
        <p id="data-uuid-bc3f72659d8a44ada715503f544a13e8" data-uuid="bc3f72659d8a44ada715503f544a13e8">The eyes and other organs that have sensory receptors provide us with valuable information about the external environment. The central nervous system, on the receiving end of millions of bits of information, integrates information, compares it with previously stored memories, and “decides” on the proper course of action. The nervous system often responds to changes in the external environment through body movement. It gives us the ability to stay in as moderate an environment as possible. Otherwise, we test the ability of the nervous system to maintain homeostasis despite extreme conditions.</p>
        <h2 id="data-uuid-ace66f26196844bfbb7725c17c87075b" data-uuid="ace66f26196844bfbb7725c17c87075b">Responding to Internal Changes</h2>
        <p id="data-uuid-4811977ba4ab4074b44b6cc1d30f9c82" data-uuid="4811977ba4ab4074b44b6cc1d30f9c82">The governance of internal organs usually requires that the nervous and endocrine systems work together. This usually occurs below the level of consciousness. Subconscious control often depends on reflex actions that involve the hypothalamus and the medulla oblongata. Let’s take blood pressure as an example. After a 3-mile run, you decide to sit down under a tree to rest a bit. When you stand up to push off again, you feel faint. The feeling quickly passes, because the medulla oblongata responds to input from the baroreceptors in the aortic arch and carotid arteries. The sympathetic system immediately acts to increase heart rate and constrict the blood vessels, so your blood pressure rises. Sweating may have upset the water-salt balance of your blood. If so, the hormone aldosterone from the adrenal cortex will act on the kidney tubules to conserve sodium ions (Na<sup>+</sup>), and water reabsorption will follow. The hypothalamus can also help by sending antidiuretic hormone (ADH) to the posterior pituitary gland, which releases it into the blood. ADH actively promotes water reabsorption by the kidney tubules.</p>
        <p id="data-uuid-a6a6bd49b8424a1e87e4d0252c36917c" data-uuid="a6a6bd49b8424a1e87e4d0252c36917c">Recall from <a href="../chapter14/ch14_reader_0.xhtml" class="link-inline">Chapter 14</a> that certain drugs, such as alcohol, can affect ADH secretion. When you consume alcohol, it is quickly absorbed across the stomach lining into the bloodstream, where it travels to the hypothalamus and inhibits ADH secretion. When ADH levels fall, the kidney tubules absorb less water. The result is increased production of dilute urine. Excessive water loss, or dehydration, is a disturbance of homeostasis. This is why drinking alcohol when you are exercising or perspiring heavily on a hot day is not a good idea. Instead of keeping you hydrated, an alcoholic beverage, such as beer, has the opposite effect.</p>

        <p id="data-uuid-bb17636545194a7a9173d49b197440b7" data-uuid="bb17636545194a7a9173d49b197440b7">Few systems intrigue us more than the reproductive system, which couldn’t function without nervous and endocrine control. The hypothalamus controls the anterior pituitary, which controls the release of hormones from the testes and the ovaries and the production of their gametes. The nervous system directly controls the muscular contractions of the ducts that propel the sperm. Contractions of the uterine tubes, which move a developing embryo to the uterus, where development continues, are stimulated by the nervous system, too. Without the positive feedback cycle involving oxytocin produced by the hypothalamus, birth might not occur.</p>

As we have seen, the hypothalamus certainly bridges the regulatory activities of the nervous and endocrine systems. In addition to producing the hormones released by the posterior pituitary, the hypothalamus produces hormones that control the anterior pituitary. The nerves of the autonomic system, which control other organs, are acted upon directly by the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus truly belongs to both the nervous and endocrine systems. Indeed, it is often and appropriately referred to as a neuroendocrine organ.</p>

Prior to the development of recombinant DNA technology, which now allows human insulin to be produced in large quantities, insulin was derived from the pancreases of pigs or cows. This required laborious purification, and because the animal insulins were not identical to the human form, sometimes immunological reactions occurred. Increasingly, insulin pumps are being used to treat diabetes. An insulin pump is a device a little bigger than a cell phone, which can deliver precise amounts of insulin under the skin using a small plastic catheter. The insulin pump more accurately mimics the pancreas’s natural release of the correct amount of insulin needed by the body. Studies have shown that insulin pumps are more effective than traditional injections of insulin in controlling blood sugar levels. In the near future, it may be possible to implant a device—sometimes called an “artificial pancreas”—into patients with diabetes that will not only monitor the blood sugar level but also provide the appropriate doses of insulin.</p>
