It is composed of two types of tissue. Exocrine tissue produces and secretes digestive juices that go by way of ducts to the small intestine (see <a href="../chapter09/ch09_reader_4.xhtml#data-uuid-b68deab019cb4aed9c3b0378d0bc70e6" class="link-inline">section 9.4</a>). The endocrine tissue is called the <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-pancreatic-islets"><dfn title="pancreatic islets">pancreatic islets</dfn></a> (islets of Langerhans). As <a href="ch16_reader_5.xhtml#data-uuid-6b458dbb178a4f14a0b8d3e37c77df8f" class="link-inline">Figure 16.17</a> illustrates, each pancreatic islet is surrounded by exocrine tissue. Within each islet are a variety of cell types, several of which play an important role in the endocrine functions of this organ. A cells are responsible for the secretion of the hormone glucagon, whereas B cells (not to be confused with the B cells of the immune system) secrete insulin. A third cell type, D cells, releases somatostatin, a hormone that is released at the same time as insulin to regulate the digestive processes. The pancreas is not under pituitary control. <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-insulin"><dfn title="insulin">Insulin</dfn></a> is secreted by the B cells when the blood glucose level is high, which usually occurs just after eating. Insulin stimulates the uptake of glucose by cells, especially liver cells, muscle cells, and adipose tissue cells. In liver and muscle cells, glucose is then stored as glycogen. In muscle cells, the glucose supplies energy for muscle contraction. Glucose enters the metabolic pool in fat cells and thereby supplies glycerol for the formation of fat. In these various ways, insulin lowers the blood glucose level (<a href="ch16_reader_5.xhtml#data-uuid-82a228f070bd46a5abfeb90789482862" class="link-inline">Fig. 16.18</a>, <i>top</i>).</p>

Of these, an estimated 7 million are undiagnosed. Diabetes is characterized by an inability of the body to maintain blood glucose homeostasis (<a href="ch16_reader_5.xhtml#data-uuid-82a228f070bd46a5abfeb90789482862" class="link-inline">Fig. 16.18</a>), resulting in an excess of glucose in the blood. This creates a number of problems with homeostasis. As the blood glucose level rises, glucose, along with water, is excreted in the urine. The term <i>mellitus</i>, from Greek, refers to “honey” or “sweetness.” As a result, diabetics urinate frequently and are always thirsty. Other symptoms of diabetes include fatigue, constant hunger, and weight loss. </p>

Diabetics often experience vision problems due to diabetic retinopathy and swelling in the lens of the eye. If untreated, diabetics often develop serious and even fatal complications. Sores that don’t heal develop into severe infections. Blood vessel damage causes kidney failure, nerve destruction, heart attack, or stroke.</p>

However, in 2014 the FDA approved an insulin inhaler as a method of delivering insulin. The inhaler provides a dry powder to the lungs, where it is absorbed into the bloodstream. The inhaler is not designed to replace injections but, rather, to provide a small dose of insulin around mealtimes.</p>

This condition is believed to be brought on by exposure to an environmental agent, most likely a virus, whose presence causes cytotoxic T cells to destroy the pancreatic islets as part of an autoimmune response (see <a href="../chapter07/ch07_reader_6.xhtml#data-uuid-5baaf51d87114549a4f6262010be4441" class="link-inline">section 7.5</a>). The body turns to the metabolism of fat, which leads to the buildup of ketones in the blood, called <i>ketoacidosis</i>, which increases the acidity of the blood and can lead to coma and death.</p>
        <p id="data-uuid-e52d58d1f91c470691cb7f422c0bd6da" data-uuid="e52d58d1f91c470691cb7f422c0bd6da">Individuals with type 1 diabetes must have daily insulin injections. These injections control the diabetic symptoms but still can cause inconveniences, because the blood sugar level may swing between hypoglycemia (low blood glucose) and hyperglycemia (high blood glucose). Without testing the blood glucose level, it is difficult to be certain which of these is present, because the symptoms can be similar. These symptoms include perspiration, pale skin, shallow breathing, and anxiety. Whenever these symptoms appear, immediate attention is required to bring the blood glucose back within the normal range. If the problem is hypoglycemia, the treatment is one or two glucose tablets, hard candy, or orange juice. If the problem is hyperglycemia, the treatment is insulin. Better control of blood glucose levels can often be achieved with an insulin pump, a small device worn outside the body that is connected to a plastic catheter inserted under the skin.</p>

Recently, progress has been made in the development of an artificial pancreas, which would act as an automated system to provide insulin based on real-time changes in blood sugar levels. It is also possible to transplant a working pancreas, or even fetal pancreatic islet cells, into patients with type 1 diabetes. Another possibility is xenotransplantation, in which insulin-producing islet cells of another species, such as pigs, are placed inside a capsule that allows insulin to exit but prevents the immune system from attacking the foreign cells. Finally, researchers are close to testing a vaccine that could block the immune system’s attack on the islet cells, perhaps by inducing the T cells capable of suppressing these responses.</p>

Often, the patient is overweight or obese, and adipose tissue produces a substance that impairs insulin receptor function. However, complex genetic factors can be involved, as shown by the tendency for type 2 diabetes to occur more often in certain families, or even ethnic groups. For example, the condition is 77% more common in African Americans than in non-Hispanic whites.</p>

In the type 2 diabetic, insulin still binds to its receptor, but the number of glucose carriers does not increase. Therefore, the cell is said to be insulin resistant.</p>

If this fails, oral drugs are available that stimulate the pancreas to secrete more insulin and enhance the metabolism of glucose in the liver and muscle cells. Millions of Americans may have type 2 diabetes without being aware of it, yet the effects of untreated type 2 diabetes are as serious as those of type 1 diabetes.</p>

Previous investigators had been unable to do this, because the enzymes in the digestive juices destroyed insulin (a protein) during the isolation procedure. Banting hit upon the idea of ligating (tying off) the pancreatic duct, which he knew from previous research would lead to the degeneration only of the cells that produce digestive juices and not of the pancreatic islets (of Langerhans), where insulin is made. His professor, J. J. Macleod, made a laboratory available to him at the University of Toronto and assigned a graduate student, Charles Best, to assist him.</p>

By the end of the summer, they had obtained pancreatic extracts that did lower the blood glucose level in diabetic dogs. Macleod then brought in biochemists, who purified the extract. Insulin therapy for the first human patient began in 1922, and large-scale production of purified insulin from pigs and cattle followed. The basic experimental system used by Banting and Best is shown in Table 16A.</p>

Gestational diabetes affects a small percentage of pregnant women. This form of diabetes is caused by insulin resistance—body insulin concentration is normal, but cells fail to respond normally. Gestational diabetes and insulin resistance generally develop later in the pregnancy. Carefully planned meals and exercise often control this form of diabetes, but insulin injections may be necessary.</p>

The extra energy in the fetus is stored as fat, resulting in macrosomia, or a “fat” baby. Delivery of a very large baby can be dangerous for both the infant and the mother; thus, cesarean section is often necessary. Complications after birth are common for these babies. Further, there is a greater risk that the child will become obese and develop type 2 diabetes mellitus later in life.</p>

However, once a woman has experienced gestational diabetes, she has a greater chance of developing it again during future pregnancies. These women also tend to develop type 2 diabetes later in life.</p>
