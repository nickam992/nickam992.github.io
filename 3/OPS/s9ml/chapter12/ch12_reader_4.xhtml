The bones that unite to form joints, or articulations, are covered with a slippery cartilage. This articular cartilage wears down over time, as friction in the joint wears it away (<a href="ch12_reader_4.xhtml#data-uuid-3c444b5d813748b7a8b243a40de10891" class="link-inline">Fig. 12B</a>). By age 80, people typically have osteoarthritis in one or more joints. By contrast, rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disorder (see <a href="../chapter07/ch07_reader_6.xhtml#data-uuid-5baaf51d87114549a4f6262010be4441" class="link-inline">section 7.5</a>) that causes inflammation within the joint. Unlike osteoarthritis, which typically affects older people, rheumatoid arthritis can afflict a person of any age, even young children. Both forms of arthritis cause a loss of the joint’s natural smoothness. This is what causes the pain and stiffness associated with arthritis. Arthritis is first treated with medications for joint inflammation and pain and with physical therapy to maintain and strengthen the joint. However, if these treatments fail, a total joint replacement is often performed. Successful replacement surgeries are now routine, thanks to the hard work and dedication of the British orthopedic surgeon Dr. John Charnley.</p>

Fused joints were immobile, and fusion didn’t always relieve the patient’s pain. Postsurgical infection was common. The bones attached to the artificial joint eroded, and the supporting muscles wasted away because the joint wasn’t useful. Charnley wanted to design a successful prosthetic hip, with the goal of replacing both parts of the diseased hip joint: the acetabulum, or “socket,” as well as the ball-shaped head of the femur. Charnley soon determined that surgical experimentation alone wasn’t enough. He studied bone repair, persuading a colleague to operate on Charnley’s tibia, or shinbone, to see how repair occurred. He studied the mechanics of the hip joint, testing different types of synthetic materials. He achieved his first success using a hip socket lined with Teflon but soon discovered that the surrounding tissues became inflamed. After multiple attempts, his perfected hip consisted of a socket of durable polyethylene. Polyethylene is still used today as the joint’s plastic component. The head of his prosthetic femur was a small, highly polished metal ball. Stainless steel, cobalt, and titanium, as well as chrome alloys, form the metal component today. Various techniques for cementing the polyethylene socket onto the pelvic bone had failed when bone pulled away from the cemented surface and refused to grow. Charnley’s surgery used dental cement, slathered onto the bone surfaces. When the plastic components were attached, cement was squeezed into every pore of the bone, allowing the bone to regenerate and grow around the plastic. Finally, Charnley devised a specialized surgical tent and instrument tray to minimize infection.</p>
            <p id="data-uuid-54d91bf7867e45e496e1618d78df63f0" data-uuid="54d91bf7867e45e496e1618d78df63f0">Charnley’s ideas were innovative and unorthodox, and he was reassigned to a former tuberculosis hospital, which he converted into a center for innovation in orthopedic surgery. His colleagues developed a prosthetic knee joint similar to the Charnley hip. In knee replacement surgery (see the chapter opener), the damaged ends of bones are removed and replaced with artificial components that resemble the original bone ends. Hip and knee replacements remain the most common joint replacement surgeries, but ankles, feet, shoulders, elbows, and fingers can also be replaced. Though many improvements on the procedure continue, the Charnley hip replacement remains the technique after which all others are modeled.</p>
            
            <p id="data-uuid-38acc8c50ab44024a0bbc8197c1b594e" data-uuid="38acc8c50ab44024a0bbc8197c1b594e" class="indent">When a joint replacement is complete, the patient’s hard work is vital to ensure the success of the procedure. Exercise and activity are critical to the recovery process. After surgery, the patient is encouraged to use the new joint as soon as possible. The extent of improvement and range of motion of the joint depend on its stiffness before the surgery, as well as the amount of patient effort during therapy following surgery. A complete recovery varies in time from patient to patient but typically takes several months. Older patients can expect their replacements to last about 10 years. However, younger patients may need a second replacement if they wear out their first prosthesis. Still, individuals who have joint replacement surgery can expect an improved quality of life and a bright future with greater independence and healthier, pain-free activity.</p>
