The sphenoid is the keystone of the cranial bones, because all the other bones articulate with it. The sphenoid completes the sides of the skull and contributes to forming the orbits (eye sockets). The <i>ethmoid bone,</i> which lies in front of the sphenoid, also helps form the orbits and the nasal septum. The orbits are completed by various facial bones. The eye sockets are called orbits because we can rotate our eyes.</p>

It is attached to the temporal bones by muscles and ligaments and to the larynx by a membrane. The larynx is the voice box at the top of the trachea in the neck region. The hyoid bone anchors the tongue and serves as the site for the attachment of muscles associated with swallowing. Due to its position, the hyoid bone does not fracture easily. In cases of suspicious death, however, a fractured hyoid is a strong sign of manual strangulation.</p>

Normally, the vertebral column has four curvatures that provide more resilience and strength for an upright posture than a straight column could provide. <i>Scoliosis</i> is an abnormal lateral (sideways) curvature of the spine.

<span class="caption-body">The vertebral column is made up of 33 vertebrae separated by intervertebral disks. The intervertebral disks make the column flexible.

The vertebral canal is in the center of the column, and the spinal cord passes through this canal. The intervertebral foramina (sing., foramen, “a hole or opening”) are found on each side of the column. Spinal nerves branch from the spinal cord and travel through the intervertebral foramina to locations throughout the body. Spinal nerves control skeletal muscle contraction, among other functions. If a vertebra is compressed, or slips out of position, the spinal cord and/or spinal nerves might be injured. The result can be paralysis or even death.</p>

The cervical vertebrae are located in the neck. The first cervical vertebra, called the <i>atlas,</i> holds up the head. It is so named because Atlas, of Greek mythology, held up the world. Movement of the atlas permits the “yes” motion of the head. It also allows the head to tilt from side to side. The second cervical vertebra is called the <i>axis,</i> because it allows a degree of rotation, as when we shake the head “no.” The thoracic vertebrae have long, thin spinous processes and articular facets for the attachment of the ribs (<a href="ch12_reader_2.xhtml#data-uuid-b4f02c80e0da47a1ae335a88a1740117" class="link-inline">Fig. 12.6<i>a</i></a>).

Pain results if a disk presses against the spinal cord and/or spinal nerves. If that occurs, surgical removal of the disk may relieve the pain.</p>

There are 12 pairs of ribs. All 12 pairs connect directly to the thoracic vertebrae in the back. A rib articulates with the body and transverse process of its corresponding thoracic vertebra. Each rib curves outward and then forward and downward.</p>

These are called “true ribs.” Ribs 8 through 12 are called “false ribs,” because their costal cartilage at the end of the ribs does not connect directly to the sternum. Ribs 11 and 12 are also called “floating ribs,” because they have no connection with the sternum.</p>

<p id="data-uuid-cccdf464fd7c4676bbc188099ecdd0fa" data-uuid="cccdf464fd7c4676bbc188099ecdd0fa">The sternum is composed of three bones. These bones are the manubrium (the handle), the body (the blade), and the xiphoid process (the point of the blade). The manubrium articulates with the clavicles of the appendicular skeleton. Costal cartilages from the first pair of ribs also join to the manubrium. The manubrium joins with the body of the sternum at an angle. This is an important anatomical landmark, because it occurs at the level of the second rib and therefore allows the ribs to be counted. Counting the ribs is sometimes done to determine where the apex of the heart is located—usually between the fifth and sixth ribs.</p>

The variably shaped xiphoid process serves as an attachment site for the diaphragm, which separates the thoracic cavity from the abdominal cavity.</p>
