The skeleton starts forming at about 6 weeks, when the embryo is only about 12 mm (0.5 in.) long. Most bones grow in length and width through adolescence, but some continue enlarging until about age 25. In a sense, bones can grow throughout a lifetime, because they are able to respond to stress by changing size, shape, and strength. This process is called remodeling. If a bone fractures, it can heal by bone repair.</p>

Here, cells derived from connective tissue cells become osteoblasts located in ossification centers. The osteoblasts secrete the organic matrix of bone. This matrix consists of mucopolysaccharides and collagen fibrils. Calcification occurs when calcium salts are added to the organic matrix. The osteoblasts promote calcification, or ossification, of the matrix. Ossification results in the formation of soft sheets, or trabeculae, of spongy bone. Spongy bone remains inside a flat bone. The spongy bone of flat bones, such as those of the skull and clavicles (collarbones), contains red bone marrow.</p>

Milk, in particular, is often fortified with vitamin D. In the kidneys, vitamin D is converted to a hormone that acts on the intestinal tract.

However, growth hormone is somewhat ineffective if the metabolic activity of cells is not promoted. Thyroid hormone, in particular, promotes the metabolic activity of cells. Too little growth hormone in childhood results in dwarfism. Too much growth hormone during childhood (prior to epiphyseal fusion) can produce excessive growth and even gigantism (see <a href="../chapter16/ch16_reader_2.xhtml#data-uuid-9e077223e851424fb06934052e7a0c87" class="link-inline">Fig. 16.8</a>). Acromegaly results from excess GH in adults following epiphyseal fusion. This condition produces excessive growth of bones in the hands and face (see <a href="../chapter16/ch16_reader_2.xhtml#data-uuid-15666894c5c34e5aa07851b5e65a5b97" class="link-inline">Fig. 16.9</a>).</p>

To illustrate that the blood calcium level is critical, recall that calcium is required for blood to clot (see <a href="../chapter06/ch06_reader_4.xhtml#data-uuid-f5e8d0cc92c14a9998958ec28adc100d" class="link-inline">section 6.4</a>). Also, if the blood calcium concentration is too high, neurons and muscle cells no longer function. If calcium falls too low, nerve and muscle cells become so excited that convulsions occur. Calcium ions are also necessary for the regulation of cellular metabolism by acting in cellular messenger systems. Thus, the skeleton acts as a reservoir for storage of this important mineral—if the blood calcium rises above normal, at least some of the excess is deposited in the bones. If the blood calcium dips too low, calcium is removed from the bones to bring it back up to the normal level.</p>
<p id="data-uuid-306ad5700f73464c918469304db2ff0e" data-uuid="306ad5700f73464c918469304db2ff0e">Two hormones in particular are involved in regulating the blood calcium level. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) stimulates osteoclasts to dissolve the calcium matrix of bone. In addition, parathyroid hormone promotes calcium reabsorption in the small intestine and kidney, increasing blood calcium levels. Vitamin D is needed for the absorption of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the digestive tract, which is why vitamin D deficiency can result in weak bones. It is easy to get enough of this vitamin, because your skin produces it when exposed to sunlight, and the milk you buy at the grocery store is fortified with vitamin D.</p>

The female sex hormone estrogen can actually increase the number of osteoblasts; the reduction of estrogen in older women is often given as reason for the development of weak bones, called osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is discussed in the Health feature, “You Can Avoid Osteoporosis.<i>”</i> In the young adult, the activity of osteoclasts is matched by the activity of osteoblasts, and bone mass remains stable until about age 45 in women. After that age, bone mass starts to decrease.</p>
<p id="data-uuid-dc166572e6154d0fa05d0b15007b5ddf" data-uuid="dc166572e6154d0fa05d0b15007b5ddf">Bone remodeling also accounts for why bones can respond to stress. If you engage in an activity that calls upon the use of a particular bone, the bone enlarges in diameter at the region most affected by the activity. During this process, osteoblasts in the periosteum form compact bone around the external bone surface and osteoclasts break down bone on the internal bone surface around the medullary cavity. Increasing the size of the medullary cavity prevents the bones from getting too heavy and thick. Today, exercises such as walking, jogging, and weight lifting are recommended. These exercises strengthen bone because they stimulate the work of osteoblasts instead of osteoclasts.</p>

The skeletal mass continues to increase until ages 20 to 30. After that, there is an equal rate of formation and breakdown of bone mass until ages 40 to 50. Then, reabsorption begins to exceed formation, and the total bone mass slowly decreases (<a href="ch12_reader_5.xhtml#data-uuid-1293bca4a9794e21958149412b3e4814" class="link-inline">Fig. 12C</a>).</p>

But we have to consider that men—unless they have taken asthma medications that decrease bone formation—tend to have denser bones than women anyway. Whereas a man’s testosterone (male sex hormone) level generally declines slowly after the age of 45, estrogen (female sex hormone) levels in women begin to decline significantly at about age 45. Sex hormones play an important role in maintaining bone strength, so this difference means that women are more likely than men to suffer a higher incidence of fractures, involving especially the hip, vertebrae, long bones, and pelvis. Although osteoporosis may at times be the result of various disease processes, it is essentially a disease that occurs as we age.</p>

Adequate dietary calcium throughout life is an important protection against osteoporosis. The National Osteoporosis Foundation (<a href="http://www.nof.org" class="link-inline">www.nof.org</a>) recommends that adults under the age of 50 take in 1,000 mg of calcium per day. After the age of 50, the daily intake should exceed 1,200 mg per day.</p>
<p id="data-uuid-3a8edb6f4fdf434a90533d54cf5f40d2" data-uuid="3a8edb6f4fdf434a90533d54cf5f40d2">A small daily amount of vitamin D is also necessary for the body to use calcium correctly. Exposure to sunlight is required to allow skin to synthesize a precursor to vitamin D. If you reside on or north of a “line” drawn from Boston to Milwaukee, to Minneapolis, to Boise, chances are you’re not getting enough vitamin D during the winter months. Therefore, you should take advantage of the vitamin D present in fortified foods such as low-fat milk and cereal. If you are under age 50, you should be receiving 400–800 IU of vitamin D per day. After age 50, this amount should increase to 800–1,000 IU of vitamin D daily.</p>

This test measures bone density based on the absorption of photons generated by an X-ray tube.  Blood and urine tests are used  to detect the biochemical markers of bone loss. Over the past several years, it has become easier for physicians to screen older women and at-risk men for osteoporosis.</p>

Although estrogen therapy does reduce the incidence of hip fractures, long-term estrogen therapy is rarely recommended for osteoporosis. Estrogen is known to increase the risk of breast cancer, heart disease, stroke, and blood clots. Other medications are available, however. Calcitonin, a thyroid hormone, has been shown to increase bone density and strength while decreasing the rate of bone fractures. Also, the bisphosphonates are a family of nonhormonal drugs used to prevent and treat osteoporosis. To achieve optimal results with calcitonin or one of the bisphosphonates, patients should also receive adequate amounts of dietary calcium and vitamin D.</p>

Just walking down the hall or up stairs was excruciating at first. Within 2 months, however, she was walking and swimming. Her physical therapist attributed her rapid return to her previous habits of staying in shape. But Jackie knows that without twenty-first-century medicine, she might have had a difficult time walking by the time she was 60. Still, she has been reminded by her doctor that all bones, even those of adults, are dynamic structures. Whereas her bone could be replaced by bone remodeling, the plastic and ceramic parts of her knees would eventually wear out. So there was a very good chance that she would have to undergo a repeat replacement of her knee in about 20 years. For Jackie, the ability to once again lead an active lifestyle was a worthwhile trade for a few months of discomfort.</p>
