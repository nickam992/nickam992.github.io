Even though external conditions may change dramatically, we have physiological mechanisms that respond to disturbances and limit the amount of internal change. Conditions usually stay within a narrow range of normalcy. For example, blood glucose, pH levels, and body temperature typically fluctuate during the day, but not greatly. If internal conditions change to any great degree, illness results.</p>

Blood delivers oxygen and nutrients to the tissues and carries away carbon dioxide and wastes.  Interstitial fluid, not blood, bathes the body’s cells. Therefore, interstitial fluid is the medium through which substances are exchanged between cells and blood. Oxygen and nutrients pass through interstitial fluid on their way to tissue cells from the blood. Then carbon dioxide and wastes are carried away from the tissue cells by the interstitial fluid and are brought back into the blood. The cooperation of body systems is required to keep these substances within the range of normalcy in blood and interstitial fluid.</p>

The nervous system is able to bring about rapid responses to any changes in the internal environment. The nervous system issues commands by electrochemical signals rapidly transmitted to effector organs, which can be muscles, such as skeletal muscles, or glands, such as sweat and salivary glands. The endocrine system brings about slower responses, but they generally have more lasting effects. Glands of the endocrine system, such as the pancreas and the thyroid, release hormones. <i>Hormones,</i> such as insulin from the pancreas, are chemical messengers that must travel through the blood and interstitial fluid to reach their targets.</p>

Picture what would happen if any component of the cardiovascular, respiratory, digestive, or urinary system failed (<a href="ch04_reader_8.xhtml#data-uuid-e1adb237127047bdad4053616a548fbb" class="link-inline">Fig. 4.15</a>). If someone is having a heart attack, the heart is unable to pump the blood to supply cells with oxygen. Or think of a person who is choking. The trachea (windpipe) is blocked, so no air can reach the lungs for uptake by the blood. Unless the obstruction is removed quickly, cells will begin to die as the blood’s supply of oxygen is depleted. When the lining of the digestive tract is damaged, as in a severe bacterial infection, nutrient absorption is impaired and cells face an energy crisis. It is important not only to maintain adequate nutrient levels in the blood but also to eliminate wastes and toxins. The liver makes urea, a nitrogenous end product of protein metabolism. Urea and other metabolic wastes are excreted by the kidneys, the urine-producing organs of the body. The kidneys rid the body of nitrogenous wastes and help adjust the blood’s water-salt and acid-base balances.</p>

When a healthy person consumes a meal and glucose enters the blood, the pancreas secretes the hormone insulin. Then glucose is removed from the blood as cells take it up. In the liver, glucose is stored in the form of glycogen. This storage is beneficial, because later, if blood glucose levels drop, glycogen can be broken down to ensure that the blood level remains constant. Homeostatic mechanisms can fail, however. In diabetes mellitus, the pancreas cannot produce enough insulin or the body cells cannot respond appropriately to it. Therefore, glucose does not enter the cells and they must turn to other molecules, such as fats and proteins, to survive. This, along with too much glucose in the blood, leads to the numerous complications of diabetes mellitus.</p>

When carbon dioxide enters the blood, it combines with water to form carbonic acid. However, the blood is buffered, and pH stays within normal range as long as the lungs are busy excreting carbon dioxide. These two mechanisms are backed up by the kidneys, which can rid the body of a wide range of acidic and basic substances and, therefore, adjust the pH.</p>

A homeostatic mechanism has at least two components: a sensor and a control center (<a href="ch04_reader_8.xhtml#data-uuid-bd262844961842e9afd5974bc8b5ab36" class="link-inline">Fig. 4.16</a>). The sensor detects a change in the internal environment. The control center then brings about an effect to bring conditions back to normal. Then the sensor is no longer activated. In other words, a negative feedback mechanism is present when the output of the system resolves or corrects the original stimulus. For example, when blood pressure rises, sensory receptors signal a control center in the brain. The center stops sending nerve signals to muscle in the arterial walls. The arteries can then relax. Once the blood pressure drops, signals no longer go to the control center.</p>

By developing an understanding of how tissues interact to form organs, it is now possible to develop synthetic tissues, such as artificial skin. Though scientists are now expanding these techniques to include the development of artificial dermal tissue, the complexity of the interactions of the various tissues (nervous, muscular, connective) in this layer has presented some obstacles. However, there have been some important advances. Recently, scientists have developed newer forms of artificial skin that release antibiotics directly onto the healing tissue, further protecting the patient against life-threatening infections. Research on artificial tissues is not confined to epithelial tissue. Scientists are exploring the development of artificial cardiac tissue and artificial replacement organs, such as the kidneys, liver, and lungs. Like Kristen’s artificial skin, these will not be plastic substitutes but, rather, organic material that integrates with the patient’s living cells to replace damaged tissue.</p>
