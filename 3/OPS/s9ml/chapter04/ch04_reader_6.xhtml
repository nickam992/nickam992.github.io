In an adult, the skin has a surface area of about 1.8 square meters (m<sup>2</sup>) (over 19.5 square feet [ft<sup>2</sup>]). It accounts for nearly 15% of the weight of an average human. The skin has numerous functions. It protects underlying tissues from physical trauma, pathogen invasion, and water loss. It also helps regulate body temperature. Therefore, skin plays a significant role in homeostasis, the relative constancy of the internal environment. The skin even synthesizes certain chemicals that affect the rest of the body. Skin contains sensory receptors, such as touch and temperature receptors. Thus, it helps us to be aware of our surroundings and to communicate with others.</p>

New epidermal cells for the renewal of skin are derived from stem (basal) cells. The importance of these stem cells is observed when there is an injury to the skin. If an injury, such as a burn, is deep enough to destroy stem cells, then the skin can no longer replace itself. As soon as possible, the damaged tissue is removed and skin grafting begins. The skin needed for grafting is usually taken from other parts of the patient’s body. This is called <i>autografting,</i> as opposed to allografting. In <i>allografting,</i> the graft is received from another person and is sometimes obtained from cadavers. Autografting is preferred, because rejection rates are low. If the damaged area is extensive, it may be difficult to acquire enough skin for autografting. In that case, small amounts of epidermis are removed and cultured in the laboratory. This produces thin sheets of skin that can be transplanted back to the patient (see the chapter opener).</p>

Hardening takes place because the cells produce <i>keratin,</i> a waterproof protein. These cells are also called <i>keratinocytes</i>. Outer skin cells are dead and keratinized, so the skin is waterproof. This prevents water loss and helps maintain water homeostasis. The skin’s waterproofing also prevents water from entering the body when the skin is immersed. Dandruff occurs when the rate of keratinization in the skin of the scalp is two or three times the normal rate. Genetically unique fingerprints and footprints are formed by a thick layer of dead, keratinized cells arranged in spiral and concentric patterns.</p>

The number of melanocytes is about the same in all individuals, so variation in skin color is due to the amount of melanin produced and its distribution. When skin is exposed to the sun, melanocytes produce more melanin. This protects the skin from the damaging effects of the ultraviolet (UV) radiation in sunlight. The melanin is passed to other epidermal cells, and the result is tanning. In some people, this results in the formation of patches of melanin called freckles. Another pigment, called carotene, is present in epidermal cells and in the dermis. It gives the skin of some Asian populations its yellowish hue. The pinkish color of fair-skinned people is due to the pigment hemoglobin in the red blood cells in the blood vessels of the dermis.</p>

Certain cells in the epidermis convert a steroid related to cholesterol into vitamin D with the aid of UV radiation. However, only a small amount of UV radiation is needed. Vitamin D leaves the skin and helps regulate both calcium and phosphorus metabolism in the body. Calcium and phosphorus have a variety of roles and are important in the proper development and mineralization of the bones.</p>

The dermis contains collagen and elastic fibers. The collagen fibers are flexible but offer great resistance to overstretching. They prevent the skin from being torn. The elastic fibers maintain normal skin tension but also stretch to allow movement of underlying muscles and joints. The number of collagen and elastic fibers decreases with age and with exposure to the sun, causing the skin to become less supple and more prone to wrinkling. The dermis also contains blood vessels that nourish the skin. When blood rushes into these vessels, a person blushes. When blood is minimal in them, a person turns “blue.” Blood vessels in the dermis play a role in temperature regulation. If body temperature starts to rise, the blood vessels in the skin dilate. As a result, more blood is brought to the surface of the skin for cooling. If the outer temperature cools, the blood vessels constrict, so less blood is brought to the skin’s surface.</p>

It is a common site for injections, which is why the instrument is called a hypodermic needle. This layer is composed of loose connective tissue and adipose tissue, which stores fat. Fat is a stored source of energy in the body. Adipose tissue helps thermally insulate the body from either gaining heat from the outside or losing heat from the inside. A well-developed subcutaneous layer gives the body a rounded appearance and provides protective padding against external assaults. Excessive development of the subcutaneous layer accompanies obesity.</p>

Botox is the registered trade name for a derivative of botulinum toxin A, a protein toxin produced by the bacterium <i>Clostridium botulinum.</i> Botox stops communication between motor nerves and muscles, causing muscle paralysis. Treatments are direct injections under the skin, where the toxin causes facial muscle paralysis. The injections reduce the appearance of wrinkles and lines that appear as a result of normal facial muscle movement. However, Botox treatment is not without side effects. Excessive drooling and a slight rash around the injection site are among the milder side effects. Spreading of Botox from the injection site may also paralyze facial muscles unintended for treatment. In a few cases, muscle pain and weakness have resulted. Though rare, more serious side effects, including allergic reactions, may also occur. When performed in a medical facility by a licensed physician, Botox treatment is generally considered safe and effective.</p>

Nails grow from epithelial cells at the base of the nail in the portion called the <i>nail root.</i> The <i>cuticle</i> is a fold of skin that hides the nail root. The whitish color of the half-moon-shaped base, or <i>lunula,</i> results from the thick layer of cells in this area. The cells of a nail become keratinized as they grow out over the nail bed.</p>

Graying occurs when melanin cannot be produced, but white hair is due to air trapped in the hair shaft.</p>

The oil secretions from sebaceous glands are acidic and retard the growth of bacteria. If the sebaceous glands fail to discharge (usually because they are blocked with keratinocytes), the secretions collect and form “whiteheads.” Over time, the sebum in a whitehead oxidizes to form a “blackhead.” Acne is an inflammation of the sebaceous glands, which most often occurs during adolescence due to hormonal changes.</p>

A sweat gland is a tubule that begins in the dermis and either opens into a hair follicle or, more often, opens onto the surface of the skin. Sweat glands play a role in modifying body temperature. When body temperature starts to rise, sweat glands become active. Sweat absorbs body heat as it evaporates. Once the body temperature lowers, sweat glands are no longer active.</p>

The recipient was a woman, Isabelle Dinoire, severely disfigured by a dog mauling. Muscles, veins, arteries, nerves, and skin were transplanted onto the lower half of Isabelle’s face (<a href="ch04_reader_6.xhtml#data-uuid-251f87b0664e46dc9407b978d27b3f4d" class="link-inline">Fig. 4B</a>, <i>top left</i>). The donor’s lips, chin, and nose were transplanted. The donor was a brain-dead patient whose family had agreed to donate all their loved one’s organs and tissues. The donor shared Isabelle’s blood type and was a good tissue match. Eighteen months after the surgery (<a href="ch04_reader_6.xhtml#data-uuid-251f87b0664e46dc9407b978d27b3f4d" class="link-inline">Fig. 4B</a>, <i>top right</i>), Isabelle was able to eat, drink, and smile.</p>

Organ transplantation has always involved some moral concerns, because the donor must still be alive when the organs are harvested. Historically, face transplants have been a “quality-of-life” issue and not a “life-or-death” surgery. However, this attitude changed as injured soldiers returning from wars in Afghanistan and Iraq underwent face transplants to treat injuries sustained in combat. Recipients of face transplants must undergo extensive counseling to prepare themselves emotionally for the “new face” and must spend the remainder of their lives on immunosuppressive drugs.</p>
