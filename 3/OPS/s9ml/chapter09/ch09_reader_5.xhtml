In humans, the appendix is thought to aid in fighting infections. Scientists have recently proposed that the appendix may also contribute to the population of needed bacteria in the large intestine. An inflamed appendix (<i>appendicitis</i>) may be treated using antibiotics or removed surgically. Should the appendix burst, the result can be <i>peritonitis,</i> a life-threatening swelling and infection of the peritoneum.</p>

The function of the large intestine is to absorb water, an important process to prevent dehydration of the body and maintain homeostasis.</p>

For many years, it was believed that <i>Escherichia coli</i> were the major inhabitants of the colon, but culture methods now show that over 99% of the colon bacteria are other types of bacteria. The bacteria in the large intestine break down indigestible material and produce B-complex vitamins and most of the vitamin K needed by our bodies.</p>

The consistency of normal feces is usually three-fourths water and one-fourth solid wastes. Bacteria, dietary <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-fiber"><dfn title="fiber">fiber</dfn></a> (indigestible remains), and other indigestible materials make up the solid wastes. Bacterial action on indigestible materials causes the odor of feces and accounts for the presence of gas. Stercobilin, which is a breakdown product of <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-bilirubin"><dfn title="bilirubin">bilirubin</dfn></a> (the yellow-orange bile pigment produced from the breakdown of hemoglobin), and oxidized iron cause the brown color of feces.</p>

Peristalsis occurs infrequently in the large intestine, but when it does, feces are forced into the rectum. Feces collect in the rectum until it is appropriate to defecate. At that time, stretching of the rectal wall initiates nerve impulses to the spinal cord. Shortly thereafter, the rectal muscles contract and the anal sphincters relax. This allows the feces to exit the body through the anus (<a href="ch09_reader_5.xhtml#data-uuid-9850524195304e82aa73c6091aedfff7" class="link-inline">Fig. 9.10</a>). A person can inhibit defecation by contracting the external anal sphincter made of skeletal muscle. Ridding the body of indigestible remains is another way the digestive system helps maintain homeostasis.</p>

The national standard for safe drinking water is 0 fecal bacteria per 100 ml of water.</p>

The major causes of diarrhea are infection of the lower intestinal tract and nervous stimulation. The intestinal wall becomes irritated, and peristalsis increases when an infection occurs. Water is not absorbed, and the diarrhea that results rids the body of the infectious organisms. In nervous diarrhea, the nervous system stimulates the intestinal wall and diarrhea results. Most people have several occurrences of diarrhea each year without suffering any health consequences. However, prolonged diarrhea can lead to dehydration because of water loss, which can lead to an imbalance of salts in the blood that can affect heart muscle contraction and potentially lead to death.</p>

Diets that lack whole-grain foods, as well as ignoring the urge to defecate, are often the causes of <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-constipation"><dfn title="constipation">constipation</dfn></a><b>.</b> When feces are not expelled regularly, additional water is absorbed from them. The material becomes drier, harder, and more difficult to eliminate. Adequate water and fiber intake can help regularity of defecation. The frequent use of laxatives is discouraged, because it can result in dependence on their use for normal bowel movements. If, however, it is necessary to take a laxative, the most natural is a bulk laxative. Like fiber, it produces a soft mass of cellulose in the colon. Lubricants such as mineral oil make the colon slippery; saline laxatives such as milk of magnesia act osmotically by preventing water from being absorbed. Some laxatives are irritants that increase peristalsis.</p>

Ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease are the most common of these. Ulcerative colitis affects the large intestine and rectum and results in diarrhea, rectal bleeding, abdominal cramps, and urgency in defecation. Crohn’s disease is normally isolated to the small intestine but can affect any area of the digestive tract, including the colon and rectum. It is characterized by the breakdown of the lining of the affected area, resulting in ulcers. Ulcers are painful and cause bleeding, because they erode the submucosal layer, where there are nerves and blood vessels. This also results in the inability to absorb nutrients at the affected sites. Symptoms of Crohn’s disease include diarrhea, weight loss, abdominal cramping, anemia, bleeding, and malnutrition.</p>

The National Cancer Institute estimates over 96,000 new cases of colon and rectal (colorectal) cancer are diagnosed per year in the United States. Some investigators believe that dietary fat increases the likelihood of colon cancer, because dietary fat causes an increase in bile secretion. It could be that intestinal bacteria convert bile salts to substances that promote the development of cancer. Fiber in the diet seems to inhibit the development of colon cancer, and regular elimination reduces the time that the colon wall is exposed to any cancer-promoting agents in feces.</p>

In a colonoscopy a flexible tube containing a camera is inserted into the GI tract, usually from the anus. The doctor may then examine the length of the colon, as well as take tissue samples (biopsies) for additional tests. However, as discussed in the Health feature, “Swallowing a Camera,” this procedure is gradually being replaced by the PillCam, a camera you swallow.</p>

This provides a more accurate diagnosis, because a larger portion of the GI tract can be examined. PillCam does not create discomfort in the patient, so the considerable risks involved with using anesthetics and painkillers are eliminated. And finally, the doctor does not need to be present for the entire procedure, saving valuable time and money for both doctor and patient.</p>
            <p id="data-uuid-14c3e0fa188b4fa9b707a0a89ce7194b" data-uuid="14c3e0fa188b4fa9b707a0a89ce7194b">However, the PillCam does have some limitations. For example, during a colonoscopy, a colonoscope, an instrument similar to an endoscope, is inserted through the anus into the large intestine. During the examination, the physician is able to remove precancerous tissue, usually polyps, for additional studies. Because a PillCam is disposable, it cannot be used to remove tissue samples for analysis, so its use as a replacement for colonoscopy is somewhat limited.</p>
