An egg lives approximately 6 to 24 hours, unless fertilization occurs. Fertilization, and therefore zygote formation, usually takes place in the uterine tube. A developing embryo normally arrives at the uterus after several days, and then <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-implantation"><dfn title="implantation">implantation</dfn></a> occurs. During implantation, the embryo embeds in the uterine lining, which has been prepared to receive it.</p>

Removal of the ovaries in addition to the uterus is technically termed an <i>ovariohysterectomy</i> (radical hysterectomy). The vagina remains, so the woman can still engage in sexual intercourse.</p>

This organ, sometimes called the womb, is approximately 5 cm wide in its usual state. It is capable of stretching to over 30 cm wide to accommodate a growing fetus. The lining of the uterus, called the <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-endometrium"><dfn title="endometrium">endometrium</dfn></a><b>,</b> participates in the formation of the placenta (see <a href="ch17_reader_4.xhtml#data-uuid-324a5c489c5d4cd3b2145ae78646f139" class="link-inline">section 17.4</a>). The endometrium supplies nutrients needed for embryonic and fetal development. The endometrium has two layers: a functional layer that is shed during each menstrual period (see <a href="ch17_reader_4.xhtml#data-uuid-324a5c489c5d4cd3b2145ae78646f139" class="link-inline">section 17.4</a>) and a basal layer of reproducing cells. In the nonpregnant female, the functional layer of the endometrium varies in thickness according to a monthly reproductive cycle called the uterine cycle.</p>

The <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-vagina"><dfn title="vagina">vagina</dfn></a> is a tube that lies at a 45° angle to the small of the back. The mucosal lining of the vagina lies in folds and can extend. This is especially important when the vagina serves as the birth canal, and it facilitates sexual intercourse when the vagina receives the penis. The vagina also acts as an exit for menstrual flow. Several different types of bacteria normally reside in the vagina and create an acidic environment. While this environment is protective against the possible growth of pathogenic bacteria, sperm prefer the basic environment provided by seminal fluid.</p>

The vulva includes two large, hair-covered folds of skin called the labia majora. The labia majora extend backward from the mons pubis, a fatty prominence underlying the pubic hair. The labia minora are two small folds lying just inside the labia majora. They extend forward from the vaginal opening to encircle and form a foreskin for the glans clitoris. The glans clitoris is the organ of sexual arousal in females and, like the penis, contains a shaft of erectile tissue that becomes engorged with blood during sexual stimulation.</p>

In the United States, more than 50% of infant males are circumcised shortly after birth. During circumcision, the glans penis is exposed when the foreskin is removed during a surgical procedure. This procedure is done before babies go home from the hospital or during religious ceremonies in the home.</p>
            <p id="data-uuid-b494d1c8f333420a821c6b65fbadc10c" data-uuid="b494d1c8f333420a821c6b65fbadc10c">The decision to circumcise a baby boy is made by the parents and is often based on their religious or cultural beliefs. Circumcision may be done so that male children will resemble their father. Some choose circumcision because of concerns about cleanliness. Claims that circumcision increases or decreases sexual pleasure later in life have not been supported by research.</p>
            <p id="data-uuid-5ea2da6a311443ee8c3c3f40bc0e993e" data-uuid="5ea2da6a311443ee8c3c3f40bc0e993e">There is some evidence that suggests urinary tract infections are less common in circumcised infants. Research also shows that circumcision reduces the spread of HIV during heterosexual contact. In areas of the world where HIV infections are prevalent, circumcision may become an important means of limiting the spread of AIDS.</p>
            <p id="data-uuid-a2f5939a9a5d4486a0eaba43ceae6750" data-uuid="a2f5939a9a5d4486a0eaba43ceae6750">As with any type of surgery, there are risks associated with circumcision. The most common complications are minor bleeding and localized infections that can be treated easily. One of the biggest concerns is the pain experienced by the baby during circumcision. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) now recommends using a form of local anesthesia during the procedure. The AAP does not recommend or argue against circumcision of male babies.</p>
            <p id="data-uuid-3f2731ae89e44ba68f22eba54cd9b81b" data-uuid="3f2731ae89e44ba68f22eba54cd9b81b">However, the circumcision of females is a highly controversial topic. Female circumcision (also referred to as female genital cutting [FGC] or female genital mutilation) is done strictly for cultural or religious reasons, though no religion specifically calls for its practice. The procedure involves partially or totally cutting away the external genitalia of a female. Cultures that practice FGC believe it to be a necessary rite of passage for girls. In the views of these cultures, FGC must be done to preserve the virginity of females and to prevent promiscuity. It is also done for aesthetic reasons, because the clitoris is thought to be an unhealthy and unattractive organ. Moreover, FGC is seen as an essential prerequisite for marriage. Females with an intact clitoris are believed to be unclean. Such women are considered to be potentially harmful to a man during intercourse or to a baby during childbirth if either is touched by the clitoris. Many believe that FGC enhances a husband’s sexual pleasure and a woman’s fertility.</p>
            <p id="data-uuid-ebbac93273974b208d3616b733215c0c" data-uuid="ebbac93273974b208d3616b733215c0c">Many girls die from infection after FGC. FGC also causes lifelong urinary and reproductive tract infections, infertility, and pelvic pain. Victims report an absent or greatly diminished pleasurable response to sexual intercourse.</p>
            <p id="data-uuid-9b7eb74c704f4db18ef876759343a262" data-uuid="9b7eb74c704f4db18ef876759343a262">FGC is most commonly performed on girls between the ages of 4 and 12 and in countries in central Africa. It is also performed in some Middle Eastern countries and among Muslim groups in various other locations. With increasing immigration from these countries, there are also greater numbers of women who have been subjected to FGC. Likewise, there are more girls in the United States who are at risk for FGC.</p>
            <p id="data-uuid-a3ff70d441784e92a1fd9b982b902b84" data-uuid="a3ff70d441784e92a1fd9b982b902b84" class="indent">Thanks to the efforts of mutilation victim Waris Dirie (<a href="ch17_reader_3.xhtml#data-uuid-1f72b0cf153b4d0b81dba5c589ded346" class="link-inline">Fig. 17A</a>) and others like her, the need to eliminate FGC is now discussed openly, and action is being taken in many countries to outlaw the practice. FGC is considered to be a violation of human rights by the United Nations, UNICEF, and the World Health Organization. It is illegal to perform FGC in many African and Middle Eastern countries, but the practice continues, because the laws are not enforced. In the United States, FGC is a criminal practice. In 1996, the United States granted asylum to a woman from Togo, who was trying to escape an arranged marriage and the FGC that would accompany it. Unfortunately, many immigrants to the United States continue the practice of FGC by sending their daughters abroad for the procedure or by importing someone to perform it. A number of educational approaches to eliminate FGC have been tried. These include community education that teaches about the harm done by FGC and the substitution of alternative rituals for the rite of passage to womanhood. Education may do even more to halt FGC, because more highly educated women are less likely to support having their daughters mutilated in this fashion.</p>

        <p id="data-uuid-7fc3bac5cff64311afcb5ed7dfbab4fb" data-uuid="7fc3bac5cff64311afcb5ed7dfbab4fb">The cleft between the labia minora contains the openings of the urethra and the vagina. The vagina may be partially closed by a ring of tissue called the hymen. The hymen is ordinarily ruptured by sexual intercourse or by other types of physical activities. If remnants of the hymen persist after sexual intercourse, they can be surgically removed.</p>
        <p id="data-uuid-2267a4a9871841fba00edd714f630a9a" data-uuid="2267a4a9871841fba00edd714f630a9a">The urinary and reproductive systems in the female are entirely separate. For example, the urethra carries only urine, and the vagina serves only as the birth canal and the organ for sexual intercourse.</p>
        <h2 id="data-uuid-f556f3c5ca474d1cbfb9754c68a5dab2" data-uuid="f556f3c5ca474d1cbfb9754c68a5dab2">Orgasm in Females</h2>
        <p id="data-uuid-56ad368c30c94858ab3c404571ffae31" data-uuid="56ad368c30c94858ab3c404571ffae31">Upon sexual stimulation, the labia minora, the vaginal wall, and the clitoris become engorged with blood. The breasts also swell, and the nipples become erect. The labia majora enlarge, redden, and spread away from the vaginal opening.</p>
        <p id="data-uuid-c1f1ccc871e5486d95592cd3b9ee71d9" data-uuid="c1f1ccc871e5486d95592cd3b9ee71d9">The vagina expands and elongates. Blood vessels in the vaginal wall release small droplets of fluid that seep into the vagina and lubricate it. Mucus-secreting glands beneath the labia minora on either side of the vagina also provide lubrication for entry of the penis into the vagina. Although the vagina is the organ of sexual intercourse in females, the clitoris plays a significant role in the female sexual response. The extremely sensitive clitoris can swell to two or three times its usual size. The thrusting of the penis and the pressure of the pubic symphyses of the partners stimulate the clitoris.</p>
        <p id="data-uuid-7dce0f6ca16547af8ee5e6d8edd118ef" data-uuid="7dce0f6ca16547af8ee5e6d8edd118ef">Orgasm occurs at the height of the sexual response. Blood pressure and pulse rate rise, breathing quickens, and the walls of the uterus and uterine tubes contract rhythmically. A sensation of intense pleasure is followed by relaxation when organs return to their normal size. Females have no refractory period, and multiple orgasms can occur during a single sexual experience.</p>
