This form of birth control has the added advantage of preventing transmission of sexually transmitted diseases. <a href="ch17_reader_5.xhtml#data-uuid-4162e8f377584384b59dce9af700aac2" class="link-inline">Table 17.4</a> lists other means of birth control used in the United States and rates their effectiveness. For example, with the birth control pill, we expect 98% effectiveness, which means that, in a given year, 2% of sexually active women using this form of birth control may get pregnant. In comparison, the withdrawal method is 75% effective. Thus, 25% of women using this form of birth control can expect to get pregnant. That makes the withdrawal method one of the least effective methods of contraception.</p>

Oral contraception, known as <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-birth-control-pill"><dfn title="birth control pill">birth control pills</dfn></a><b>,</b> are the most effective form of contraception. These pills contain a combination of estrogen and progesterone. Most birth control pills are taken daily. For the first 21 days, the pills contain active hormones. This is followed by 7 days of inactive pills. The estrogen and progesterone in the birth control pill or a patch applied to the skin effectively shuts down the pituitary production of both FSH and LH. Follicle development in the ovary is prevented. Because ovulation does not occur, pregnancy cannot take place. Women taking birth control pills or using a patch should see a physician regularly because of possible side effects.</p>

A male condom is most often a latex sheath that fits over the erect penis (<a href="ch17_reader_5.xhtml#data-uuid-e4f71ea20d7d4469bed48eadac305caf" class="link-inline">Fig. 17.14<i>c</i></a>). The ejaculate is trapped inside the sheath and thus does not enter the vagina. When used in conjunction with a spermicide, the protection is better than with the condom alone.</p>

For example, a vaccine intended to immunize women against HCG, the hormone so necessary to maintaining the implantation of the embryo, was successful in a limited clinical trial. Because HCG is not normally present in the body, no autoimmune reaction is expected, but the immunization does wear off with time. Others believe that it would also be possible to develop a safe antisperm vaccine that could be used in women.</p>

Preven includes four synthetic progesterone pills; two are taken up to 72 hours after unprotected intercourse, and two more are taken 12 hours later. The hormone upsets the normal uterine cycle, making it difficult for an embryo to implant in the endometrium. One study estimated that Preven was 85% effective in preventing unintended pregnancies. The Preven kit also includes a pregnancy test; women are instructed to take the test first before using the hormone, because the medication is not effective on an established pregnancy.</p>

It is available without a prescription to women age 17 and older. In August 2010, ulipristal acetate (also known as ella) was also approved for emergency contraception. It can be taken up to 5 days after unprotected sex, and studies indicate it is somewhat more effective than Plan B One-Step. Unlike Plan B One-Step, however, a prescription is required.</p>

This causes the endometrium to slough off, carrying the embryo with it. When taken in conjunction with a prostaglandin to induce uterine contractions, RU-486 is 95% effective at inducing an abortion up to the 49th day of gestation. Because of its mechanism of action, the use of RU-486 is more controversial compared to other medications, and while it is currently available in the United States for early medical abortion, it is not approved for emergency contraception.</p>

The sperm are then largely reabsorbed. Following this operation, which can be done in a doctor’s office, the amount of ejaculate remains normal because sperm account for only about 1% of the volume of semen. Also, there is no effect on the secondary sex characteristics, because testosterone continues to be produced by the testes.</p>

However, many men do not realize that it is still possible to father a child for several months following a vasectomy. This is because after the procedure some sperm remain in the vas deferens. Males who have had a vasectomy need to use alternate forms of birth control for 1 to 2 months or until their physician has performed a follow-up sperm count and verified that sperm are no longer present in the ejaculate. In very rare situations, the vas deferens may reconnect, allowing sperm to once again be ejaculated. While the only 100% effective form of contraception is abstinence, vasectomies are considered to be over 99.8% effective.</p>

In women of normal weight, fat cells produce a hormone called leptin, which stimulates the hypothalamus to release GnRH. FSH release and normal follicle development follow. In overweight women, leptin levels are higher, which impacts GnRH and FSH. The ovaries of many overweight women contain many small follicles that fail to ovulate. Other causes of infertility in females are blocked uterine tubes due to pelvic inflammatory disease (see <a href="ch17_reader_6.xhtml#data-uuid-0b79ff380432465aaa9e0d3c83745460" class="link-inline">section 17.6</a>) and endometriosis. <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-endometriosis"><dfn title="endometriosis">Endometriosis</dfn></a> is the presence of uterine tissue outside the uterus, particularly in the uterine tubes and on the abdominal organs. Backward flow of menstrual fluid allows living uterine cells to establish themselves in the abdominal cavity.

Whereas surgeries are now very sophisticated, they nonetheless have risks, including bleeding, infection, organ damage, and adverse reactions to anesthesia. Similar risks are associated with collecting eggs for in vitro fertilization (IVF). To ensure the collection of several eggs, a woman may be placed on hormone-based medications that stimulate egg production. Such medications may cause ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome—enlarged ovaries and abdominal fluid accumulation. In mild cases, the only symptom is discomfort; but in severe cases (though rare), a woman’s life may be endangered. In any case, the fluid has to be drained.</p>

The mother is more likely to develop complications, such as gestational diabetes and high blood pressure, than are women carrying single babies. Positioning of the babies in the uterus may make vaginal delivery less likely, and there is likely a chance of preterm labor. Babies born prematurely face numerous hardships. Infant death and long-term disabilities are also more common with multiple births. This is true even of twins. Even if all babies are healthy, parenting “multiples” poses unique challenges.</p>

Its popularity has brought a number of ethical issues to light. For example, the estimated high numbers of stored frozen embryos (a few hundred thousand in the United States) has generated debate about their fate, complicated by the fact that the long-term viability of frozen embryos is not well understood. Scientists may worry that embryos donated to other couples are ones screened out from one implantation and not likely to survive. Some religious groups strongly oppose destruction of these embryos or their use in research. Patients for whom the embryos were created generally feel that they should have sole rights to make decisions about their fate. However, a fertility clinic may no longer be receiving monetary compensation for the storage of frozen embryos and may be unable to contact the couples for whom they were produced. The question then becomes whether the clinic now has the right to determine their fate.</p>

What if the prospect of a satisfactory outcome is very slim or almost nonexistent? This may happen when one of the partners is ill or the woman is at an advanced age. Should a physician go ahead with treatment even if it might endanger a woman’s (or baby’s) health? Those in favor of limiting treatment argue that a physician has a responsibility to prevent potential harm to a patient. On the other hand, there is concern that if certain people are denied fertility for medical reasons, might they be denied for other reasons also, such as race, religion, sexuality, or income?</p>

Ultrasound machines can now spot follicles in the ovaries that hold immature eggs; therefore, the latest method is to forgo the administration of fertility drugs and retrieve immature eggs by using a needle. The immature eggs are then brought to maturity in glassware, and then concentrated sperm are added. After about 2 to 4 days, the embryos are ready to be transferred to the uterus of the woman, who is now in the secretory phase of her uterine cycle. If desired, the embryos can be tested for a genetic disease, and only those found to be free of disease will be used. If implantation is successful, development is normal and continues to term.</p>

Gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT) was devised to overcome the low success rate (15–20%) of in vitro fertilization. The method is the same as in vitro fertilization, except the eggs and the sperm are placed in the uterine tubes immediately after they have been brought together. GIFT has the advantage of being a one-step procedure for the woman—the eggs are removed and reintroduced all at the same time. A variation on this procedure is to fertilize the eggs in the laboratory and then place the zygotes in the uterine tubes.</p>
