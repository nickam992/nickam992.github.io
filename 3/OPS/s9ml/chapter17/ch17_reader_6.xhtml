The helper T cells are the very cells that stimulate an immune response (see <a href="../chapter07/ch07_reader_4.xhtml#data-uuid-4f6a2dc013dd429a80ae170d6734e574" class="link-inline">section 7.4</a>), so loss of these cells causes the immune system to become severely impaired in persons with AIDS. During the first stage of an HIV infection, symptoms are few, but the individual is highly contagious. Several months to several years after infection, the helper T-lymphocyte count falls. Following this decrease, infections, such as other sexually transmitted diseases, begin to appear. In the last stage of infection, called AIDS, the helper T-cell count falls way below normal. At least one opportunistic infection is present. Such diseases have the opportunity to occur only because the immune system is severely weakened. Persons with AIDS typically die from an opportunistic disease, such as <i>Pneumocystis</i> pneumonia.</p>

Many times, carriers either do not have any sign of warts or merely have flat lesions. When present, the warts commonly are seen on the penis and foreskin of men and near the vaginal opening in women. A newborn can become infected while passing through the birth canal.</p>

However, visible warts that are removed may recur. A vaccine has been released for the human papillomaviruses that most commonly cause genital warts. This development is an extremely important step in the prevention of cancer, as well as in the prevention of warts themselves. Genital warts are associated with cancer of the cervix (see <a href="ch17_reader_0.xhtml#data-uuid-a1607f9b15f14dfa8ff3778bae28c419" class="link-inline">chapter opener</a>), as well as tumors of the vulva, vagina, anus, and penis. Researchers believe that these viruses may be involved in up to 90% of all cases of cancer of the cervix. HPV vaccinations, which are recommended for both women and men before the age of 26, might make such cancers a thing of the past.</p>

Some people exhibit no symptoms. Others may experience a tingling or itching sensation before blisters appear on the genitals. Once the blisters rupture, they leave painful ulcers, which may take between 5 days and 3 weeks to heal. The blisters may be accompanied by fever; pain on urination; swollen lymph nodes in the groin; and in women, a copious discharge. At this time, the individual has an increased risk of acquiring an HIV infection.</p>

Fever, stress, sunlight, and menstruation are associated with recurrence of symptoms. Exposure to herpes in the birth canal can cause an infection in the newborn, which leads to neurological disorders and even death. Birth by cesarean section prevents this possibility. There are antiviral drugs available that reduce the number and length of outbreaks. However, these drugs are not a cure for genital herpes. Latex or polyurethane condoms are recommended by the FDA to prevent the transmission of the virus to sexual partners.</p>

Six known viruses cause hepatitis, designated A, B, C, D, E, and G. Hepatitis A is usually acquired from sewage-contaminated drinking water, but this infection can also be sexually transmitted through oral-anal contact. Hepatitis B is spread through sexual contact and by blood-borne transmission (accidental needlestick on the job, receiving a contaminated blood transfusion, a drug abuser sharing infected needles while injecting drugs, from mother to fetus, etc.). Simultaneous infection with hepatitis B and HIV is common, because both share the same routes of transmission. Fortunately, a combined vaccine is available for hepatitis A and B. It is recommended that all children receive the vaccine to prevent infection (see <a href="../chapter07/ch07_reader_0.xhtml" class="link-inline">Chapter 7</a>). Hepatitis C (also called <i>non-A, non-B hepatitis</i>) causes most cases of posttransfusion hepatitis. Hepatitis D and G are sexually transmitted, and hepatitis E is acquired from contaminated water. Screening of blood and blood products can prevent transmission of hepatitis viruses during a transfusion. Proper water-treatment techniques can prevent contamination of drinking water.</p>

This very painful condition can result in blockage of the uterine tubes, with the possibility of sterility and infertility. If a baby comes in contact with chlamydia during birth, inflammation of the eyes or pneumonia can result.</p>

Oral-genital contact can cause infection of the mouth, throat, and tonsils. Gonorrhea can spread to internal parts of the body, causing heart damage or arthritis. If, by chance, the person touches infected genitals and then touches his or her eyes, a severe eye infection can result. Up to now, gonorrhea was curable by antibiotic therapy. However, resistance to antibiotics is becoming more and more common, and <i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i> is now classified as a “super-bug,” meaning that it has developed resistance to a variety of antibiotics.</p>

As with many other bacterial diseases, penicillin is an effective antibiotic. Syphilis has three stages, often separated by latent periods, during which the bacteria are resting before multiplying again. During the primary stage, a hard chancre (ulcerated sore with hard edges) indicates the site of infection. The chancre usually heals spontaneously, leaving little scarring. During the secondary stage, the victim breaks out in a rash that does not itch and is seen even on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. Hair loss and infectious gray patches on the mucous membranes may also occur. These symptoms disappear of their own accord.</p>

It is the most commonly diagnosed gynecologic condition. Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is believed to cause 40–50% of the cases of vaginitis in the United States. Overgrowth of certain bacteria inhabiting the vagina causes vaginosis. A common culprit is the bacterium <i>Gardnerella vaginosis.</i> Overgrowth of this organism and subsequent symptoms can occur for nonsexual reasons. However, symptomless males can pass on the bacterium to women, who do experience symptoms.</p>
        <p id="data-uuid-e8ed8fce03f240b786e6ff65fbf9edef" data-uuid="e8ed8fce03f240b786e6ff65fbf9edef">The symptoms of BV are vaginal discharge that has a strong odor, a burning sensation during urination, and/or itching or pain in the vulva. Some women with BV have no signs of the infection. How women acquire these infections is not well understood. Having a new sex partner or multiple sex partners seems to increase the risk of getting BV, but females who are not sexually active get BV as well. Douching also appears to increase the incidence of BV. Women with BV are more susceptible to infection by other STDs, including HIV, herpes, chlamydia, and gonorrhea. Pregnant women with BV are at greater risk of premature delivery.</p>
        <p id="data-uuid-40fb0ef2952d45dfa5aa760804e488a9" data-uuid="40fb0ef2952d45dfa5aa760804e488a9">The yeast <i>Candida albicans,</i> and a protozoan, <i>Trichomonas vaginalis,</i> are two other causes of vaginitis. <i>Candida albicans</i> is normally found living in the vagina. Under certain circumstances, its growth increases above normal, causing vaginitis. For example, women taking birth control pills or antibiotics may be prone to yeast infections. Both can alter the normal balance of vaginal organisms, causing a yeast infection. A yeast infection causes a thick, white, curdlike vaginal discharge and is accompanied by itching of the vulva and/or vagina. Antifungal medications inserted into the vagina are used to treat yeast infections. Trichomoniasis, caused by <i>Trichomonas vaginalis,</i> affects both males and females. The urethra is usually the site of infection in males. Infected males are often asymptomatic and pass the parasite to their partner during sexual intercourse. Symptoms of trichomoniasis in females are a foul-smelling, yellow-green, frothy discharge and itching of the vulva/vagina. Having trichomoniasis greatly increases the risk of infection by HIV. Prescription drugs are used to treat trichomoniasis, but if one partner remains infected, reinfection will occur. It is recommended that both partners in a sexual relationship be treated and abstain from having sex until the treatment is completed.</p>

For individuals with cervical cancer, the survival rate for those who have early detection is almost 100%, versus a less than 5% survival rate for those in whom the cancer has begun to spread, or metastasize, to other organs. In Ann’s case, the years of smoking cigarettes probably were a major factor in her development of cervical cancer. However, for many cases of cervical cancer, the cause is the human papillomavirus, or HPV. Over 15 forms of HPV have been linked to cervical cancers. In 2006, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved an HPV vaccine for women. The vaccine is designed to be administered as three doses starting between the ages of 11 and 12 years. Recently, the vaccine was also approved for men ages 9 to 26 to prevent genital warts and to reduce the chances that men will transmit HPV to their sexual partners. With the development of the HPV vaccine, it is hoped that the rates of cervical cancer in women will drop drastically over the next few decades.</p>
