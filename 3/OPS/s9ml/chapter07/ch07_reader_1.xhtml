They may be found both on inanimate objects and on the surfaces and interiors of plants and animals. While the term often is associated with diseases, in fact, many of the activities of microbes are useful to humans. We eat foods produced by bacteria, and they contribute to the production of yogurt, cheese, bread, beer, wine, and many pickled foods. Drugs available through biotechnology are produced by bacteria. Microbes help us in still another way. Without the activity of decomposers, the biosphere (including ourselves) would cease to exist. When a tree falls to the forest floor, it eventually rots, because decomposers, including bacteria and fungi, break down the remains of dead organisms to inorganic nutrients. Plants need these inorganic nutrients to make the many molecules that become food for us.</p>

For example, it is important to have a tetanus shot, because the bacterium that causes this disease, <i>Clostridium tetani,</i> produces a toxin that prevents relaxation of muscles. In time, the body contorts, because all the muscles have contracted; if no medical treatment is available, suffocation can occur.</p>

The speed at which bacteria reproduce depends on a number of factors, including moisture in the environment and temperature. At the temperatures found in most refrigerators and freezers, bacterial growth is slowed but the bacteria are not killed. Once the temperature returns to a favorable level, the bacteria resume normal cell division. The only way to kill most food-related bacteria is by using high temperatures, such as those used in boiling or thorough cooking.</p>

Viruses gain entry into and are specific to a particular host cell, because portions of the virus are specific for a receptor on the host cell’s outer surface. Once the virus is attached, the viral genetic material (DNA or RNA) enters the cell. Inside the cell, the nucleic acid codes for the protein units in the capsid. In addition, the virus may have genes for special enzymes needed for the virus to reproduce and exit from the host cell. In large measure, however, a virus relies on the host’s enzymes and ribosomes for its own reproduction.</p>

            <p id="data-uuid-ac8c9706e8364fed84b774ce8226423a" data-uuid="ac8c9706e8364fed84b774ce8226423a">Studies show that using antibacterial soap when washing your hands is no more effective in preventing the spread of bacteria than using pure soap and water. In some cases, the main ingredient in most antibacterial soaps, triclosan, may actually cause some bacteria to become resistant to certain drugs, such as amoxicillin, which is used to kill bacteria. Waterless hand sanitizers (which are alchohol-based) are recommended for use in conjunction with, not as a replacement for, regular hand washing. Furthermore, some states are banning these cleansers because of concerns over chemicals entering the water supply. Proper hand washing and sanitizing can prevent the spread of colds, flus, and certain diarrhea disorders when done often and properly.</p>

Originally thought to be viral diseases, <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-Creutzfeldt-Jakob-disease-CJD"><dfn title="Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD)">Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease <em>(</em>CJD<em>)</em></dfn></a> in humans; scrapie in sheep; and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), commonly called mad cow disease,<em> in cattle are all caused by prions.</em> These infections are apparently transmitted by ingestion of brain and nerve tissues from infected animals. Prion proteins are believed to play the role of a “housekeeper” in the brains of healthy individuals. However, in some people, a rogue form of the prion protein folds into a new shape and in the process loses its original function. The rogue protein is able to refold normal prion proteins into the new shape and thus cause disease. Nervous tissue is lost, and calcified plaques show up in the brain due to prion activity. The incidence of prion diseases in humans is very low.</p>
