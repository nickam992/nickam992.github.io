The responses to these antigens, called <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-allergen"><dfn title="allergen">allergens</dfn></a><b>,</b> usually include some degree of tissue damage.</p>

The response is caused by IgE antibodies (see <a href="ch07_reader_4.xhtml#data-uuid-f2631857864b41489653b91078e0166e" class="link-inline">Table 7.1</a>). IgE antibodies are attached to receptors on the plasma membrane of mast cells in the tissues and to basophils in the blood. When an allergen attaches to the IgE antibodies on these cells, the cells release histamine and other substances that bring about the allergic symptoms. When pollen is an allergen, histamine stimulates the mucous membranes of the nose and eyes to release fluid. This causes the runny nose and watery eyes typical of hay fever. If a person has asthma, the airways leading to the lungs constrict, resulting in difficult breathing accompanied by wheezing. When food contains an allergen, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea often result.</p>

Bee stings and penicillin shots are known to cause this reaction, because both inject the allergen into the blood. Anaphylactic shock is characterized by a sudden and life-threatening drop in blood pressure due to increased permeability of the capillaries by histamine. Taking epinephrine can counteract this reaction until medical help is available.</p>
        <p id="data-uuid-b304176e2bf046579487686ba557e3b1" data-uuid="b304176e2bf046579487686ba557e3b1">People with allergies produce ten times more IgE than those without allergies. A new treatment using injections of monoclonal IgG antibodies for IgEs is being tested in individuals with severe food allergies. More routinely, injections of the allergen are given, so that the body will build up high quantities of IgG antibodies. The hope is that IgG antibodies will combine with allergens received from the environment before they have a chance to reach the IgE antibodies located in the membrane of mast cells and basophils.</p>

The allergic response is regulated by the cytokines secreted by both T cells and macrophages. A classic example of a delayed allergic response is the skin test for tuberculosis (TB). When the test result is positive, the tissue where the antigen was injected becomes red and hardened. This shows that there was prior exposure to the bacterium that causes TB. Contact dermatitis, which occurs when a person is allergic to poison ivy, jewelry, cosmetics, and many other substances that touch the skin, is also an example of a delayed allergic response.</p>

Rejection of transplanted tissue results because the recipient’s immune system recognizes that the transplanted tissue is not “self.” Cytotoxic T cells respond by attacking the cells of the transplanted tissue.</p>
        <p id="data-uuid-87d1cc4705994566b3c047574346a7d1" data-uuid="87d1cc4705994566b3c047574346a7d1">Organ rejection can be controlled by carefully selecting the organ to be transplanted and administering <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-immunosuppressive"><dfn title="immunosuppressive">immunosuppressive</dfn></a> drugs. It is best if the transplanted organ has the same type of MHC antigens as those of the recipient, because cytotoxic T cells recognize foreign MHC antigens. Two well-known immunosuppressive drugs, cyclosporine and tacrolimus, act by inhibiting the production of certain T-cell cytokines.</p>

Scientists have chosen to use the pig because animal husbandry has long included the raising of pigs as a meat source, and pigs are prolific. Genetic engineering can make pig organs less antigenic. The ultimate goal is to make pig organs as widely accepted as type O blood.</p>

Scientists have transplanted lab-grown urinary bladders into human patients. They hope that production of organs lacking HLA antigens will one day do away with the problem of rejection.</p>

When a person has an immune deficiency, the immune system is unable to protect the body against disease. Infrequently, a child may be born with an impaired immune system. For example, in <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-severe-combined-immunodeficiency-disease-SCID"><dfn title="severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID)">severe combined immunodeficiency <em>(</em>SCID<em>)</em></dfn></a>, both antibody- and cell-mediated immunity are lacking or inadequate. Without treatment, even common infections can be fatal. Bone marrow transplants and gene therapy have been successful in SCID patients. Acquired immune deficiencies can be caused by infections, chemical exposure, or radiation. Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a result of an infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). As a result of a weakened immune system, AIDS patients show a greater susceptibility to infections and have a higher risk of cancer (see <a href="../chapter08/ch08_reader_0.xhtml" class="link-inline">Chapter 8</a>).</p>

In reality, being vaccinated is a lifelong activity. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has identified a series of vaccinations that are recommended after the age of 18 (<a href="ch07_reader_6.xhtml#data-uuid-fe1a86e76f2041b5838bcae16c274175" class="link-inline">Table 7A</a>). In many cases, vaccinations are recommended when an individual is determined to be at risk for a specific disease or condition. For example, while the vaccination for hepatitis B (HepB) may not be required, it is recommended for individuals who have had more than one sexual partner during a 6-month period, have been diagnosed with a sexually transmitted disease (STD; see <a href="../chapter17/ch17_reader_0.xhtml" class="link-inline">Chapter 17</a>), use injection drugs, or may have been exposed to blood or infected body fluid. In most cases, vaccinations are recommended as a protective measure even if you are not in an at-risk category.</p>

It is thought that antigen-antibody complexes, complement, neutrophils, activated T cells, and macrophages are all involved in the destruction of cartilage in the joints. A person with <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-systemic-lupus-erythematosus"><dfn title="systemic lupus erythematosus">systemic lupus erythematosus</dfn></a><b> (SLE)</b>, commonly just called <i>lupus,</i> has various symptoms, including a facial rash, fever, and joint pain. In these patients, damage to the central nervous system, heart, and kidneys can be fatal. SLE patients produce high levels of anti-DNA antibodies. All human cells (except red blood cells) contain DNA, so the symptoms of lupus interfere with tissues throughout the body. <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-myasthenia-gravis"><dfn title="myasthenia gravis">Myasthenia gravis</dfn></a> develops when antibodies attach to and interfere with the function of neuromuscular junctions.

            <p id="data-uuid-8959f8b93c8443ef96b78335af37f786" data-uuid="8959f8b93c8443ef96b78335af37f786"><span class="dropcap-letter">L</span>upus is an autoimmune disease. The immune system normally makes antibodies that attack foreign cells to keep the body healthy. In an autoimmune disease, the person’s immune system makes antibodies that attack the healthy cells of the body, instead of invading pathogen cells. Abigail’s immune system was attacking her, in addition to attacking any bacteria and viruses that got into her system. Lupus is also considered a rheumatic disease, or a disorder that affects the muscles, joints, and connective tissue. That explained the pain in her arms and legs.</p>
            <p id="data-uuid-f6211dc783ef4be397af29d6d70a5895" data-uuid="f6211dc783ef4be397af29d6d70a5895">The doctor went on to detail that she believed Abigail had a type of lupus called systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). SLE is the most common form of lupus, affecting multiple organ systems. It is most commonly seen developing in people in their twenties and thirties, although it is not uncommon for symptoms to develop in people as young as 10 years old. The exact cause of lupus is unclear; it has been suggested that there is a genetic predisposition to lupus that can be activated by infection, stress, and even increasing levels of estrogen. The doctor explained that 90% of the 1.5 million Americans living with lupus (an estimated 10,000 of them are children under 18) are female.</p>

The physician recommended that Abigail have a team of health-care professionals help her manage her lupus: a rheumatologist to manage her muscle and joint pain; a dermatologist to help with the periodic rashes; and a nephrologist, or kidney specialist, because lupus patients tend to develop kidney problems. Abigail is currently on a daily NSAID (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug) to control muscle and joint pain. During a flare-up, she can also take corticosteroids to control inflammation. With proper care and caution, Abigail can keep her lupus in check, decrease the severity of flare-ups, and live a healthy and productive life.</p>
