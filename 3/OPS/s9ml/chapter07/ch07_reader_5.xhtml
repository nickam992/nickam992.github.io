However, active immunity is often induced when a person is well to prevent future infection. Artificial exposure to an antigen through immunization can prevent future disease. The United States is committed to immunizing all children against the common types of childhood disease. A full list of recommended childhood vaccinations is available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website at <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines" class="link-inline">www.cdc.gov/vaccines</a>. Information on recommended adult vaccinations is provided in the Health feature, “Adult Vaccinations” (see <a href="ch07_reader_6.xhtml#data-uuid-5baaf51d87114549a4f6262010be4441" class="link-inline">section 7.5</a>) .</p>

Traditionally, vaccines are the pathogens themselves, or their products, that have been treated to be no longer virulent (able to cause disease). Today, it is possible to genetically engineer bacteria to mass-produce a protein from pathogens, and this protein can be used as a vaccine. This method is used to produce the vaccine for the viral-induced disease hepatitis B, and a vaccine for malaria made by the same method is currently going through FDA approval.</p>

For several days, no antibodies are present. Then the titer rises slowly, levels off, and gradually declines as the antibodies bind to the antigen or simply break down (<a href="ch07_reader_5.xhtml#data-uuid-f5a11a32f8c64b02aaefc7494b0f1d5b" class="link-inline">Fig. 7.12</a>). After a second exposure to the vaccine, a secondary response is expected. The titer rises rapidly to a level much greater than before. Then it slowly declines. The second exposure is called a “booster,” because it boosts the antibody titer to a high level. The high antibody titer now is expected to help prevent disease symptoms, even if the individual is exposed to the disease-causing antigen.</p>

These antibodies are not produced by the individual’s plasma cells, so passive immunity is temporary. For example, newborn infants are passively immune to some diseases because IgG antibodies have crossed the placenta from the mother’s blood (<a href="ch07_reader_5.xhtml#data-uuid-17aa92b4228248dd8885fa1761445b6a" class="link-inline">Fig. 7.13<i>a</i></a>). These antibodies soon disappear, and within a few months, infants become more susceptible to infections. Breast-feeding prolongs the natural passive immunity an infant receives from the mother, because IgG and IgA antibodies are present in the mother’s milk (<a href="ch07_reader_5.xhtml#data-uuid-17aa92b4228248dd8885fa1761445b6a" class="link-inline">Fig. 7.13<i>b</i></a>).</p>

Usually, the patient receives a gamma globulin injection of serum that contains antibodies, in some cases taken from individuals who have recovered from the illness (<a href="ch07_reader_5.xhtml#data-uuid-17aa92b4228248dd8885fa1761445b6a" class="link-inline">Fig. 7.13<i>c</i></a>). For example, a health-care worker who suffers an accidental needlestick may come in contact with the blood from a patient infected with hepatitis virus. Immediate treatment with a gamma globulin injection (along with simultaneous vaccination against the virus) can typically prevent the viruses from causing infection.</p>

Cytokines regulate white blood cell formation and/or function, so they are being investigated as a possible adjunct therapy (treatments used in conjunction with the primary treatment) for cancer and AIDS. Both interferon, produced by virus-infected cells, and <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-interleukin"><dfn title="interleukin">interleukins</dfn></a><b>,</b> produced by various white blood cells, have been used as immunotherapeutic drugs. These are used particularly to enhance the ability of the individual’s T cells to fight cancer.</p>

Whenever cancer develops, it is possible that cytotoxic T cells have not been activated. In that case, cytokines might awaken the immune system and lead to the destruction of the cancer. In one technique, researchers withdrew T cells from the patient and presented cancer cell antigens to the isolated T cells. The cells were then activated by culturing them in the presence of an interleukin. The T cells were reinjected into the patient, who was given doses of interleukin to maintain the killer activity of the T cells.</p>

They are currently used as treatment adjuncts for chronic diseases such as psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and irritable bowel syndrome and are sometimes used to treat chronic infectious diseases and to treat cancer. Interleukin antagonists also may prove helpful in preventing skin and organ rejection, autoimmune diseases such as lupus and Crohn’s disease, and allergies.</p>
