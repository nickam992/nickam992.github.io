Interstitial fluid is mostly water, but it also contains solutes (i.e., nutrients, electrolytes, and oxygen) derived from plasma.

The larger thoracic duct returns lymph collected from the body below the thorax, the left arm, and left side of the head and neck into the left subclavian vein.

In a child, most bones have red bone marrow; in an adult, it is limited to the sternum, the vertebrae, the ribs, part of the pelvic girdle, and the upper ends of the humerus and femur. In addition to the red blood cells, bone marrow produces the various types of white blood cells: neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes. Lymphocytes are either <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-B-cell-B-lymphocyte"><dfn title="B cell (B lymphocyte)">B cells <em>(</em>B lymphocytes<em>)</em></dfn></a> or <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-T-cell-T-lymphocyte"><dfn title="T cell (T lymphocyte)">T cells <em>(</em>T lymphocytes<em>)</em></dfn></a>.

Thymosin may also have other functions in immunity. (2) Immature T lymphocytes migrate from the bone marrow through the bloodstream to the thymus, where they mature. Only about 5% of these cells ever leave the thymus. These T lymphocytes have survived a critical test: If any show the ability to react with the individualâs cells, they die in the thymus. If they have potential to attack a pathogen, they can leave the thymus. The thymus is absolutely critical to immunity because without mature, properly functioning T cells, the bodyâs response to specific pathogens is poor or absent.</p>

The spleen, the largest lymphatic organ, is located in the upper left region of the abdominal cavity posterior to the stomach. Connective tissue divides the spleen into regions known as white pulp and red pulp. The red pulp, which surrounds venous sinuses (cavities), is involved in filtering the blood. Blood entering the spleen must pass through the sinuses before exiting. Here, macrophages that are like powerful vacuum cleaners engulf pathogens and debris, such as worn-out red blood cells.</p>

When the body is invaded by a bacterium or virus, individual nodes can swell from 1/2 to 2 inches in diameter. Cuts, burns, bites, rashes, and any break in the skin can cause an infection and thus the swelling of your lymph nodes. Swollen nodes near the groin mean infection on a leg or the lower abdomen; in your armpits, they mean infection on the arms or chest; and on the front of your neck, they mean an infection in the ears, nose, or throat. Some diseases, such as chickenpox, can cause all your nodes to swell.</p>
