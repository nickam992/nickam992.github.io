Fragments of bacteria, viruses, molds, and parasitic worms can all be antigenic. Further, abnormal plasma membrane proteins produced by cancer cells may also be antigens. We do not ordinarily become immune to our own normal cells, so it is said that the immune system is able to distinguish self from nonself.</p>

B cells and T cells are capable of recognizing antigens because they have specific antigen receptors. These antigen receptors are plasma membrane proteins whose shape allows them to combine with particular antigens. Each lymphocyte has only one type of receptor. It is often said that the receptor and the antigen fit together like a lock and key. We encounter millions of different antigens during our lifetime, so we need a diversity of B cells and T cells to protect us against them. Remarkably, this diversification occurs during the maturation process. Millions of specific B cells and/or T cells are formed, increasing the likelihood that at least one will recognize any possible antigen.</p>

The BCRs of B cells bind to whole, intact antigens, while the TCRs of T<sub>H</sub> and T<sub>C</sub> cells bind only to antigens that are processed and presented by MHC proteins on the surface of other cells. When activated by antigens, B cells differentiate into antibody-secreting plasma cells, T<sub>H</sub> cells become cytokine-secreting cells, and T<sub>C</sub> cells are able to destroy virus-infected or cancer cells. Each cell type also produces memory cells,  which can respond more quickly to a subsequent exposure to the same antigen.</span>

Only the B cell with a BCR that has a shape that fits the antigen (green circle) undergoes clonal expansion. During clonal expansion, cytokines secreted by helper T (T<sub>H</sub>) cells (discussed later in this section) stimulate B cells to clone. Most of the cloned B cells become <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-plasma-cell"><dfn title="plasma cell">plasma cells</dfn></a><b>,</b> which circulate in the blood and lymph. Plasma cells are larger than regular B cells, because they have extensive rough endoplasmic reticulum. This is for the mass production and secretion of antibodies to a specific antigen. Antibodies identical to the BCR of the activated B cell are secreted from the plasma B cell. Some cloned B cells become memory cells, the means by which long-term immunity is possible. If the same antigen enters the system again, memory B cells quickly divide and transform into plasma cells. The correct type of antibody can quickly be produced by these plasma cells.</p>

Antibodies may consist of single Y-shaped molecules, called <i>monomers,</i> or may be paired together in a molecule termed a <i>dimer.</i> Some very large antibodies (IgM—see the next section) are pentamers—clusters of five Y-shaped molecules linked together.</p>

IgG antibodies are the major type in blood, and smaller amounts are found in lymph and interstitial fluid. IgG antibodies bind to pathogens and their toxins. IgG antibodies can cross the placenta from a mother to her fetus, so the newborn has temporary, partial immune protection. IgM antibodies are pentamers; they are the first antibodies produced by a newborn’s body. IgM antibodies are the first to appear in blood soon after an infection begins and the first to disappear before the infection is over. They are good activators of the complement system. IgA antibodies are monomers or dimers containing two Y-shaped structures. They are the main type of antibody found in body secretions: saliva, tears, mucus, and breast milk. IgA molecules bind to pathogens and prevent them from reaching the bloodstream. The main function of IgD molecules seems to be to serve as antigen receptors on immature B cells. IgE antibodies are responsible for prevention of parasitic worm infections, but they can also cause immediate allergic responses.</p>

For example, the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) is present in the urine of a pregnant woman. A monoclonal antibody can be used to detect this hormone. Monoclonal antibodies are also used to identify infections such as H1N1 flu, HIV, and RSV, a respiratory virus infection common in young children. Because they can be used to distinguish between cancerous and normal tissue cells, they are also used to carry radioisotopes or toxic drugs to tumors, which can then be selectively destroyed. Trastuzumab (Herceptin) is a monoclonal antibody used in the treatment of breast cancer. It binds to a protein receptor on breast cancer cells and prevents the cancer cells from dividing as quickly. Antibodies that bind to cancer cells also can activate the complement system and can increase phagocytosis by macrophages and neutrophils.</p>

Unlike B cells, however, T cells are unable to recognize an antigen without help. The antigen must be displayed to them by an <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-antigen-presenting-cell-APC"><dfn title="antigen-presenting cell (APC)">antigen-presenting cell <em>(</em>APC<em>)</em></dfn></a>, such as a macrophage. After phagocytizing a pathogen, such as a bacterium, APCs travel to a lymph node or the spleen, where T cells also congregate. In the meantime, the APC has broken the pathogen apart in a lysosome. A piece of the pathogen is then displayed in the groove of a <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-major-histocompatibility-complex-MHC"><dfn title="major histocompatibility complex (MHC)">major histocompatibility complex <em>(</em>MHC<em>)</em></dfn></a> protein on the cell’s surface.

These proteins are found on all of our body cells. There are three general groups of HLAs (HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-DR), each with a number of protein variations. Each person has a unique combination of HLAs. One exception are the HLAs of identical twins. Because identical twins arise from division of a single zygote, their HLA proteins are identical. MHC antigens are self proteins, because they mark the cell as belonging to a particular individual. The importance of self proteins in plasma membranes was first recognized when it was discovered that they contribute to the specificity of tissues and make it difficult to transplant tissue from one human to another. Comparison studies of the three classes of HLAs must always be carried out before a transplant is attempted. The greater the number of these proteins that match, the more likely the transplant will be successful.</p>

These T cells go on to destroy cells carrying foreign antigens, while leaving normal body cells unharmed.</p>
