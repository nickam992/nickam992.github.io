The use of antibiotics does not cause humans to become resistant to the drugs. Instead, pathogens become resistant. There are some organisms in a population naturally resistant to the drug (<a href="ch08_reader_3.xhtml#data-uuid-bad3c801e3144ff48ed5c92cd562bc1a" class="link-inline">Fig. 8.15</a>). They have acquired this resistance through mutations or interactions with other organisms. The drug regimen kills the susceptible ones while leaving naturally resistant ones to multiply and repopulate the patient’s body. The new population is then resistant to the drug. Tuberculosis, malaria, gonorrhea, <i>Staphylococcus aureus,</i> and enterococci (or group D <i>Streptococcus</i>) are a few of the diseases and organisms connected to antibiotic resistance. Unfortunately, more and more organisms are becoming multidrug resistant, leaving health-care facilities with little choice for treatment of infection.</p>

The CDC, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and U.S. Department of Agriculture have formed a cooperative organization charged with monitoring antibiotic-resistant organisms. Pharmaceutical companies are developing new antibiotics. However, the best way to fight antibiotic resistance is to prevent it from happening in the first place by using antibiotics wisely. Take all of the antibiotics prescribed as directed. Do not skip doses or discontinue treatment when you feel better. Do not expect a doctor to prescribe antibiotics for all infections. For example, antibiotics are ineffective in treating viral infections, such as colds. Do not save unused antibiotics or take antibiotics prescribed for a different infection. Antibiotics are important drugs for fighting infection, and improper usage lessens their effectiveness for all of us.</p>

It is resistant to almost all the drugs used to treat TB. This includes the first-line antibiotics, the older and cheaper ones, as well as the second-line antibiotics, the newer and more expensive drugs. Therefore, the treatment options are very limited. Fortunately, this is still relatively rare. There were only 83 cases in the United States between 1993 and 2007. MDR TB, multidrug-resistant TB, is more common. These organisms are resistant to the first-line antibiotics. Eastern Europe and Southeast Asia have the highest rates of MDR TB.</p>

The CDC put him under federal quarantine in Atlanta. Patients with XDR TB should not be traveling on airlines, and the CDC recommended testing for passengers and crew on those flights.</p>

MRSA is resistant to methicillin and other common antibiotics, such as penicillin and amoxicillin. It causes “staph” infections, such as boils and infection of the hair follicles. In 1974, only 2% of staph infections were caused by MRSA, but by 2004, the number had risen to 63%. In response, the CDC conducted an aggressive campaign to educate health-care workers on MRSA prevention. The program was very successful, and between 2005 and 2008 the number of MRSA infections in hospitals declined by 28%.</p>

MRSA is also prevalent in nursing homes and hospitals where patients have already reduced immune responses. Patients infected with MRSA generally have longer hospital stays with poorer outcomes. It can be fatal. It is passed from nonsymptomatic carriers to patients, usually through hand contact. Hand washing is critical for preventing transmission.</p>

The good news is that the rate of MRSA infections has been falling consistently since 2005, mostly due to an increased awareness among health professionals.</p>

Emerging diseases represent a potentially serious health threat, not only because our bodies lack the ability to effectively fight off the pathogen but also because of limitations to our health-care system. Emerging diseases often have unique animal hosts, symptoms, and modes of transmission and therefore can present significant challenges for the medical community as it attempts to identify effective prevention and treatment strategies.</p>
