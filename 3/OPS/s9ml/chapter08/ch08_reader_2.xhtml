These are considered <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-emerging-diseases"><dfn title="emerging diseases">emerging diseases</dfn></a><b>.</b> The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) lists 18 pathogens that are newly recognized in the last two decades and five additional pathogens that are considered to be reemerging. Reemerging diseases are ones that have reappeared after a significant decline in incidence. <i>Streptococcus,</i> the bacterium that causes strep throat and other infections, is considered to be a reemerging pathogen due to increasing resistance to antibiotics. Finally, there are diseases that have been known throughout human history but had not been known to be caused by an infectious agent or the pathogen had never been identified. Ulcers caused by <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> (recognized in 1983) are an example.</p>

Some of these diseases may result from new and/or increased exposure to animals or insect populations that act as vectors for disease. Changes in human behavior and use of technology can result in new diseases. SARS is thought to have arisen in Guandong, China, due to consumption of civets, a type of exotic cat considered a delicacy. The civets were possibly infected by exposure to horseshoe bats sold in open markets. Legionnaires disease emerged in 1976 due to contamination of a large air-conditioning system in a hotel. The bacteria thrived in the cooling tower used as the water source for the air-conditioning system. In addition, globalization results in the transport of diseases all over the world that were previously restricted to isolated communities. The first SARS cases were reported in southern China the week of November 16, 2002. By the end of February 2003, SARS had reached nine countries/provinces, mostly through airline travel. Some pathogens mutate and change hosts, jumping from birds to humans, for example. Before 1997, avian flu was thought to affect only birds. A mutated strain jumped to humans in the 1997 outbreak. To control that epidemic, officials killed 1.5 million chickens to remove the source of the virus.</p>
        <p id="data-uuid-c9b65d176eb84d6cbd1af320eb6fea68" data-uuid="c9b65d176eb84d6cbd1af320eb6fea68">The virus that causes Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS, is another example of an emerging virus that is causing concern in the medical community. Like SARS, MERS is a coronavirus (MERS-CoV). These classes of viruses are known to cause respiratory problems, including shortness of breath, coughing, and fever. What makes MERS unique is the fact that it appears to be a novel class of coronavirus that had not previously been detected in humans.<br />

While the virus appeared to be confined to the Middle East for a few years, it has made its way into some countries of Europe. The first reported case of MERS in the United States occurred in 2014. The source of the MERS virus is still being investigated. The virus is known to also infect camels and some species of bats (<a href="ch08_reader_2.xhtml#data-uuid-99b882f67a234065a8570b88b0595825" class="link-inline">Fig. 8.14</a>). However, the precise animal host is still unknown. Like other viruses, MERS can be transmitted between individuals by close contact. Infection by the MERS virus may be very dangerous, with complications such as pneumonia and kidney failure. Presently, the mortality rate associated with MERS is around 30%.<br />

Reemerging diseases have been known in the past but were thought to have been controlled. Diseases in this category include known diseases that are spreading from their original geographic location and diseases that have suddenly increased in incidence. A change in geographic location could be due to global warming, allowing expansion of habitats for insect vectors. Reemerging diseases can also be due to human carelessness, as in the abuse of antibiotics or poorly implemented vaccination programs. This allows previously controlled diseases to resurge.</p>
