There are two main types of HIV: HIV-1 and HIV-2. HIV-1 is the more widespread, virulent form of HIV. Of the two types of HIV, HIV-2 corresponds to a type of immunodeficiency virus found in the green monkey, which lives in western Africa. In addition, researchers have found a virus identical to HIV-1 in a subgroup of chimpanzees once common in west-central Africa. Perhaps HIV viruses were originally found only in nonhuman primates. They could have mutated to HIV after humans ate nonhuman primates for meat.</p>

Most importantly, HIV infects and destroys cells of the immune system, particularly helper T cells and macrophages. As the number of helper T cells declines, the body’s ability to fight an infection also declines. As a result, the person becomes ill with various diseases. AIDS is the advanced stage of HIV infection, in which a person develops one or more of a number of opportunistic infections. An <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-opportunistic-infection"><dfn title="opportunistic infection">opportunistic infection</dfn></a> is one that has the <i>opportunity</i> to occur only because the immune system is severely weakened.</p>

However, the exact dates of the first human cases of HIV are still being investigated. Recent molecular analyses of the HIV virus suggest that the virus may have first infected humans sometime between 1884 and 1924. Direct evidence of HIV in humans has been obtained from tissue and blood samples taken in the 1950s and 1960s. HIV has been found in a preserved 1959 blood sample taken from a man who lived in an African country now called the Democratic Republic of the Congo. British scientists have been able to show that AIDS came to their country perhaps as early as 1959. They examined the preserved tissues of a Manchester seaman who had died that year and concluded that he had most likely died of AIDS. Similarly, it is thought that HIV entered the United States on numerous occasions as early as the 1950s. But the first documented case is a 15-year-old male who died in Missouri in 1969, with skin lesions now known to be characteristic of an AIDS-related cancer. Doctors froze some of his tissues, because they could not identify the cause of death. Researchers also want to test the preserved tissue samples of a 49-year-old Haitian who died in New York in 1959 of the type of pneumonia now known to be AIDS-related.</p>

Most likely, some of these people actually died of AIDS. HIV is not extremely infectious. Thus, it took several decades for the number of AIDS cases to increase to the point that AIDS became recognizable as a specific and separate disease. The name <i>AIDS</i> was coined in 1982, and HIV was found to be the cause of AIDS in 1983–84.</p>

Among the 2.3 million new HIV infections, nearly 20% are in people under the age of 15. Although the number of deaths due to HIV/AIDS is declining, in 2012 the disease still claimed 1.6 million lives, bringing the total number of deaths attributed to HIV/AIDS to over 36 million. As of 2012, at least 0.8% of the adults in the world had an HIV infection.</p>

HIV-1C is prominent in Africa, and HIV-1B causes most infections in the United States. The following description of the phases of HIV infection pertains to an HIV-1B infection. The helper T cells and macrophages infected by HIV are called <i>CD4 cells,</i> because they display a molecule called CD4 on their surface. With the destruction of CD4 cells, the immune system is significantly impaired. After all, macrophages present the antigen to helper T cells. In turn, helper T lymphocytes coordinate the immune response. B lymphocytes are stimulated to produce antibodies, and cytotoxic T cells destroy cells infected with a virus. In the United States, one of the most common causes of AIDS deaths is <i>Pneumocystis jiroveci</i> pneumonia (PCP); in Africa, tuberculosis kills more HIV-infected people than any other AIDS-related illness.</p>

The classification of HIV infection will be discussed in three categories (phases); the system is based on two aspects of a person’s health—the CD4 T-cell count and the history of AIDS-defining illnesses.</p>

The viral load is the number of HIV particles in the blood. At the start of an HIV-1B infection, the virus replicates ferociously, and the killing of CD4 T cells is evident, because the blood level of these cells drops dramatically. During the first few weeks of infection, some people (1–2%) develop flulike symptoms (fever, chills, aches, swollen lymph nodes) that may last an average of 2 weeks. After this, a person may remain “symptom free” for years. At the beginning of this acute phase of infection, an HIV antibody test is usually negative, because it generally takes an average of 25 days before there are detectable levels of HIV antibodies in body fluids.</p>
        <p id="data-uuid-0c6fd28fd65c4d759c8f9fd3b8c05e49" data-uuid="0c6fd28fd65c4d759c8f9fd3b8c05e49">After time, the body responds to the infection by increased activity of immune cells, and the HIV blood test becomes positive. During this phase, the number of CD4 T cells is greater than the viral load (<a href="ch08_reader_1.xhtml#data-uuid-54ae06667d3b42e8adcdc02507a6af76" class="link-inline">Fig. 8.7</a>), but some investigators believe that an unseen battle is going on. The body is staying ahead of the hordes of viruses entering the blood by producing as many as 1 to 2 billion new helper T lymphocytes each day. This is called the “kitchen-sink model” for CD4 T-cell loss. The sink’s faucet (production of new CD4 T cells) and the sink’s drain (destruction of CD4 T cells) are wide open. As long as the body can produce enough new CD4 T cells to keep pace with the destruction of these cells by HIV and by cytotoxic T cells, the person has a healthy immune system that can deal with the infection. In other words, a person in category A has no history of the conditions listed in categories B and C.</p>

Body secretions, such as semen from an infected male, contain proviruses inside CD4 T cells. When this semen is discharged into the vagina, rectum, or mouth, infected CD4 T cells migrate through the organ’s lining and enter the body. The receptive partner in anal-rectal intercourse appears to be most at risk, because the lining of the rectum is apparently prone to penetration. CD4 macrophages present in tissues are believed to be the first infected when proviruses enter the body. When these macrophages move to the lymph nodes, HIV begins to infect CD4 T cells. HIV can hide out in local lymph nodes for some time, but eventually the lymph nodes degenerate. Large numbers of HIV particles can then enter the bloodstream. Now the viral load begins to increase; when it exceeds the CD4 T-cell count, the individual progresses to the final phase of an HIV infection.</p>

Also, needle sharing among intravenous drug users is high-risk behavior. A less common mode of transmission (and now rare in countries where blood is screened for HIV) is through transfusions of infected blood or blood-clotting factors. Babies born to HIV-infected women may become infected before or during birth or through breast-feeding after birth. From a global perspective, heterosexual sex is the main mode of HIV transmission. In some nations, however, men who have sex with men, IV drug abusers, and sex industry (prostitution) workers are the most common transmitters of HIV. Differences in cultures, sexual practices, and belief systems around the world influence the type of HIV prevention strategies needed to fight the spread of the disease.</p>

However, HIV is not transmitted through casual contact in the workplace, schools, or social settings. Casual kissing, hugging, or shaking hands doesn’t spread the virus. Likewise, you can’t be infected by touching toilet seats, doorknobs, dishes, drinking glasses, food, or pets. The general message of HIV prevention across the globe is abstinence, sex with only one uninfected partner, or consistent use of a condom during sexual encounters.</p>

Most people will develop antibodies to HIV within 2–8 weeks (average of 25 days), but it can take from 3–6 months.

But since late 1995, scientists have gained a much better understanding of the structure of HIV and its life cycle. Now, therapy is available that successfully controls HIV replication. Patients remain in the chronic phase of infection for a variable number of years, meaning that the development of AIDS is postponed. However, this is not the case for those in poor nations where funds for HIV drugs are limited. Only 20% of those worldwide who need antiretroviral therapy are receiving this treatment.</p>

In general, the term <i>test</i> indicates that a sample (blood, urine) is collected and then sent to a registered lab for analysis. A “rapid test” is performed on-site by a registered health-care worker. In a “home test,” the person purchasing the kit collects the samples, performs the tests, and analyzes the results. For a home test, the data are not necessarily verified by a registered health-care worker. Although an Internet search and a visit to almost any drugstore reveal a number of over-the-counter (OTC) home tests for HIV, the only home test that is currently approved by the FDA is called the OraQuick In-Home HIV Test. This test provides results within 20 minutes, but the individual is still advised to confirm the presence of the virus using a blood test. The FDA has approved a number of rapid tests that may be used to detect the presence of HIV antibodies in the blood. Currently, these tests need to be performed by registered lab professionals, since these tests do not provide immediate results, but instead involve sending a sample to a registered lab. The results are reported in about 7 days. As is always the case, it is highly recommended that you talk with your physician regarding the results of any form of medical test.</p>

HAART uses a combination of drugs that interfere with the life cycle of HIV. Entry inhibitors stop HIV from entering a cell. The virus is prevented from binding to a receptor in the plasma membrane. Reverse transcriptase inhibitors, such as zidovudine (AZT), interfere with the operation of the reverse transcriptase enzyme. Integrase inhibitors prevent HIV from inserting its genetic material into that of the host cells. Protease inhibitors prevent protease from cutting up newly created polypeptides. Assembly and budding inhibitors are in the experimental stage, and none are available as yet. Ideally, a drug combination will make the virus less likely to replicate or successfully mutate. If reproduction can be suppressed, viral resistance to this therapy will be less likely to occur and the drugs won’t lose their effectiveness. However, investigators have found that when HAART is discontinued, the virus rebounds.</p>

In 2012 alone, 1.6 million people received HIV antiretroviral therapy for the first time. This is largely due to programs such as the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, which began as a commitment from the United States to provide $15 billion in antiretroviral drugs to resource-poor countries from 2003 to 2008. Since then, the program has been continued and expanded.  Since 2002, there has been a 40-fold increase in the number of people with access to antiretroviral treatment, yet despite these global efforts only approximately 34% of the people eligible globally were receiving treatment in 2013. A study published in 2009 showed the PEPFAR program had cut AIDS death rates by more than 10% in targeted countries in Africa, though it had no appreciable effect on the prevalence of the disease in those nations.</p>

If possible, drug therapy should be delayed until the tenth to twelfth week of pregnancy to minimize any adverse effects of AZT on fetal development. If treatment begins at this time and delivery is by cesarean section, the chance of transmission from mother to infant is very slim (about 1%).</p>

Unfortunately, none of these would be a cure. Instead, the vaccine would be a preventive measure that helps people who are not yet infected escape infection (preventive vaccine). Alternatively, a therapeutic vaccine could slow the progression of the disease on future infection. Scientists have studied more than 50 different preventive vaccines and over 30 therapeutic vaccines. A large-scale clinical trial (called RV144) of a preventive vaccine concluded in 2009 in Thailand; though there is some evidence that the vaccine may help reduce HIV infection rates, researchers are still analyzing the data and working on follow-up studies. Still, the success of RV144 has encouraged researchers in believing that the development of a preventive vaccine may be possible in the near future. The Science feature, “The Challenges of Developing an AIDS Vaccine,<i>”</i> reviews the difficulties in developing an effective AIDS vaccine. Thus, you can understand why we do not have an AIDS vaccine yet and, indeed, why we may never have an ideal one.</p>

The process can take many years. After a vaccine has been tested in animals, it must pass through three phases of clinical trials before it is marketed or administered to the public. In Phases I and II, the vaccine is tested from 1 to 2 years in a small number of HIV-uninfected volunteers. The most effective vaccines move into Phase III. In Phase III, the vaccine is tested 3 to 4 years in thousands of HIV-uninfected people. A Phase III trial of the RV144 HIV vaccine was conducted from 2003 to 2009 in Thailand and involved over 16,000 volunteers. The vaccine was reported to reduce the rate of HIV infection by 32%. Although this is a much lower percentage than will be needed for a vaccine to be considered effective, most scientists have many reasons to be optimistic that an AIDS vaccine can and will be developed. The RV144 results, and other successes with vaccinating monkeys, suggest that the research is beginning to yield results. But the most compelling reason for optimism is the human body’s ability to suppress the infection. The immune system is able to successfully and effectively decrease the HIV viral load in the body, helping delay the onset of AIDS an average of 10 years in 60% of people who are HIV-infected in the United States. Studies have shown that a small number of people remain HIV-uninfected after repeated exposure to the virus, and a few HIV-infected individuals maintain a healthy immune system for over 15 years. It is these stories of the human body’s ability to fight HIV infection that keep scientists hopeful that there is a way to help the body fight HIV infection. Most scientists agree that—despite the obstacles or the setbacks—an AIDS vaccine is possible in our future.</p>

At that time, TB caused 14% of deaths in Europe. The disease was called <i>consumption,</i> because it seemed to consume the patients from the inside until they wasted away. In the 1940s, with the advent of effective antibiotics to fight TB, it was thought that the disease could be eliminated. However, control measures were not implemented consistently and tuberculosis cases began to rise in the 1980s. It is estimated that one-third of the world’s population has been exposed to TB. In 2012, approximately 8.6 million people were infected with TB, and 1.3 million died. HIV infections are a contributing factor to the increase in TB cases. Tuberculosis is currently the number one cause of death in AIDS patients.</p>

The most common drugs are isoniazid (INH), rifampin (RIF), ethambutol, and pyrazinamide. Though it is unlikely that bacteria will develop resistance to multiple drugs at the same time, there are several drug-resistant forms of TB. Examples are multidrug-resistant TB (MDR TB), which is resistant to both isoniazid and rifampin, and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR TB), a rare form of TB that is resistant to isoniazid and rifampin, plus one additional antibiotic. It takes at least 6 months to kill all the <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> in the body, so the length of drug treatment is long.</p>

Active TB patients are isolated for at least 2 weeks at the beginning of drug treatment to prevent transmission. Thereafter, they are monitored for drug compliance and reappearance of symptoms. Anyone exposed to an active case of TB is treated.</p>

Most people in the West do not even consider malaria a major health threat, yet in 2012 there were 207 million new cases, with over 627,000 deaths, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa (<a href="ch08_reader_1.xhtml#data-uuid-8d14bf8074bd40c8baf1776a72da0a67" class="link-inline">Fig. 8.12</a>). Key to the geographic distribution of malaria is transmission of the disease by a mosquito vector that depends on temperature and rainfall and thus survives well in tropical areas. A <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-vector"><dfn title="vector">vector</dfn></a> is a living organism—usually an insect or animal—that transfers the pathogen from one host to another.</p>

There are four species that infect humans: <i>P. malariae, P. falciparum, P. vivax,</i> and <i>P. ovale. P. falciparum</i> causes more disease and death than the other species. The parasite is spread by the female <i>Anopheles gambiae</i> mosquito. Half of the life cycle occurs in the human, and the remainder happens in the mosquito. As the female mosquito feeds on human blood, she injects saliva containing an anticoagulant along with the parasite. The parasites travel to the liver, where they undergo asexual reproduction. The parasites are released from the liver to infect more liver cells and erythrocytes (red blood cells). Inside the erythrocyte, the <i>Plasmodium</i> enlarges and divides until it bursts the erythrocyte. This red blood cell stage is cyclic and repeats every 48 to 72 hours. Some parasites within the erythrocytes don’t destroy their host cells. Instead, they develop into the sexual form of the parasite. When these are ingested by another mosquito during a blood meal, they develop into male and female gametes within the gut of the mosquito. The gametes fuse, undergo mitosis, and form the parasites that migrate to the salivary glands of the mosquito to continue the cycle.</p>

Children, pregnant women, and travelers are most likely to fall victim to the disease. Diagnosis of malaria depends on the presence of parasites in the blood. The incubation period from time of bite to onset of symptoms varies from 7 to 30 days. The symptoms of malaria range from very mild to fatal. Most infected people develop a flulike illness with chills and fevers interrupted by sweating. These symptoms exhibit a cyclical pattern every 48 to 72 hours corresponding to bursting of the red blood cells in the body. Milder cases of malaria are often confused with influenza or a cold; therefore, treatment is delayed. More severe cases cause severe anemia (due to destruction of red blood cells), cerebral malaria, acute kidney failure, cardiovascular collapse, shock, and death.</p>

A person exhibiting malaria symptoms should be treated within 24 hours of onset. Common antimalarial drugs include quinine and artesunate. Treatment helps reduce symptoms and breaks the transmission pattern for the disease. Antimalarial drugs can also be used prophylactically, or before infection. They do not prevent the initial infection following the mosquito bite. Instead, they prevent the development of the parasites in the blood.</p>

Strategies include eliminating the mosquito by removing its breeding sites and by insecticide fogging of large areas. Additional efforts are aimed at preventing humans from being bitten by the mosquito, using simple mosquito nets. The use of insecticide-treated mosquito nets for children has reduced the incidence of malaria.</p>

Influenza is a viral infection that causes runny nose, cough, chills, fever, head and body aches, and nausea. You can catch influenza by inhaling virus-laden droplets that have been coughed or sneezed into the air by an infected person, or by contact with contaminated objects, such as door handles or bedding. The viruses then attach to and infect cells of the respiratory tract.</p>

Its H spike allows the virus to bind to its receptor, and its N spike attacks host plasma membranes in a way that allows mature viruses to exit the cell. Both H spikes and N spikes have variations in their shapes: 16 types of H and 9 types of N spikes are known. Furthermore, each type of spike can occur in different varieties called subtypes. Many of the influenza viruses are assigned specific codes based on the type of spike. For example, H5N1 virus gets its name from its variety of H5 spikes and its variety of N1 spikes. Our immune system can recognize only the particular variety of H spikes and N spikes it has been exposed to in the past by infection or immunization. When a new influenza virus arises, one for which there is little or no immunity in the human population, a flu pandemic (global outbreak) may occur.</p>

An H5N1 is common in wild birds, such as waterfowl, and can readily infect domestic poultry, such as chickens, which is why it is referred to as an avian influenza or a bird flu. An H5N1 virus has infected waterfowl for some time without causing serious illness. A more pathogenic version of H5N1 appeared about a decade ago in China and promptly started to cause widespread and severe illness in domestic chickens. Scientists are still trying to determine what made H5N1 become so lethal, first to chickens and then to humans.</p>
        <p id="data-uuid-a18bb5d5cf3045cf9ad9d4ebef1d9cc0" data-uuid="a18bb5d5cf3045cf9ad9d4ebef1d9cc0">Why can bird flu H5N1 infect humans? Because the virus can attach to both a bird flu receptor and a human flu receptor. Close contact between domestic poultry and humans is necessary for this to happen. At this time, the virus has rarely been transmitted from one human to another, and only among people who have close contact with one another, such as members of the same household. The concern is that with additional mutations, the H5N1 virus could become capable of sustained human-to-human transmission, and then spread around the world.</p>
        <p id="data-uuid-9a5b19d85d7f4382b7d4a6df66196488" data-uuid="9a5b19d85d7f4382b7d4a6df66196488">How could H5N1 become better at spreading within the human population? At this time, bird flu H5N1 infects mostly the lungs. Most human flu viruses infect the upper respiratory tract, trachea, and bronchi and can be spread by coughing. If a spontaneous mutation in the H spike of H5N1 enabled it to attack the upper respiratory tract, then it could be easily spread from human to human by coughing and sneezing. Another possibility is that a combining of spikes could occur in a person who was infected with both the bird flu and the human flu viruses (<a href="ch08_reader_1.xhtml#data-uuid-1add748907614cb5ab1f232962def4ab" class="link-inline">Fig. 8.13<i>b</i></a>). According to the CDC, over the past decade an increasing number of humans infected with an H5N1 virus have been reported in Asia, the Pacific, the Near East, Africa, and Europe. Over half of these people have died. The good news is that the FDA has approved an H5N1 vaccine for individuals between the ages of 18 and 64. While additional mutations in the virus may reduce the overall effectiveness of the vaccine, it is believed to provide a good foundation of protection against this form of influenza.</p>
