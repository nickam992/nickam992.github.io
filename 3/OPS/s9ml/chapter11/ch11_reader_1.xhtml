As you know, salts, such as NaCl, have the ability to influence the rate and direction of osmosis (see <a href="../chapter03/ch03_reader_3.xhtml#data-uuid-afddf8edf1904b83aa2538565b77948e" class="link-inline">section 3.3</a>). Therefore, the more salts there are in the blood, the greater the blood volume and the greater the blood pressure. By regulating the concentration of certain ions, namely sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) and potassium (K<sup>+</sup>), in the blood, the kidneys regulate blood pressure. In addition to ions, the kidneys also maintain the appropriate blood level of ions such as potassium (K<sup>+</sup>), bicarbonate (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup>), and calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>).</p>

For a person to remain healthy, the blood pH should be just about 7.4. The kidneys monitor and help control blood pH, mainly by excreting hydrogen ions (H<sup>+</sup>) and reabsorbing the bicarbonate ions (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup>) as needed to keep blood pH at 7.4. Urine usually has a pH of 6 or lower, because our diet often contains acidic foods.</p>

The kidneys are bean-shaped and reddish-brown in color. The fist-sized organs are covered by a tough capsule of fibrous connective tissue, called a renal capsule. Masses of adipose tissue adhere to each kidney.

They are small, muscular tubes about 25 cm long and 5 mm in diameter. The wall of a ureter has three layers: an inner mucosa (mucous membrane), a smooth muscle layer, and an outer fibrous coat of connective tissue. Peristaltic contractions cause urine to enter the bladder even if a person is lying down. Urine enters the bladder in spurts at the rate of one to five per minute.</p>

A floating kidney may develop in people who are very thin or in someone who has recently received a sharp blow to the back. When the kidney becomes dislodged, it may form a kink in the ureter, causing urine to back up into the kidney. This can result in damage to the structures inside the kidney. Surgery can correct a floating kidney by reattaching it to the abdominal wall.</p>

The epithelium of the mucosa becomes thinner, and folds in the mucosa called <i>rugae</i> disappear as the bladder enlarges. The bladder’s rugae are similar to those of the stomach. A layer of transitional epithelium enables the bladder to stretch and contain an increased volume of urine. The urinary bladder has a maximum capacity of between 700 and 800 ml.</p>

After urine enters the bladder from a ureter, small folds of bladder mucosa act as a valve to prevent backward flow. Two sphincters in close proximity are found where the urethra exits the bladder. The internal sphincter occurs around the opening to the urethra. It is composed of smooth muscle and is involuntarily controlled. An external sphincter is composed of skeletal muscle that can be voluntarily controlled.</p>

Muscle contraction causes strong feelings of urgency to go to the bathroom. Use of medications, such as tolterodine (Detrol LA) and oxybutynin (Ditropan XL), control the symptoms by blocking nerve signals to the bladder and calming the bladder’s muscle contractions. An overactive bladder can also be treated without medication by urinating at set times of the day or by doing exercises to strengthen the muscles that control urination.</p>

The short length of the female urethra makes bacterial invasion of the urinary tract easier. In males, the urethra averages 20 cm when the penis is flaccid (limp, nonerect). As the urethra leaves the male urinary bladder, it is encircled by the prostate gland. The prostate sometimes enlarges, restricting the flow of urine in the urethra.

In one study, each patient contributed cells from his or her own diseased bladder. Those cells were cultured in a lab and encouraged to form a new bladder by growing them on a collagen form shaped like a bladder. Eventually, the new bladders were attached to each patient's diseased bladders. This alleviated the incontinence problems the patients had experienced. The risk of kidney damage was also decreased in these individuals by lowering the pressure inside their enlarged bladders. Because the cells for the new bladders had been taken from the patients, there was no risk of rejection.</p>

The prostate gland produces and adds a fluid to semen as semen passes through the urethra within the penis. At about age 50, the prostate gland often begins to enlarge, growing from the size of a walnut to that of a lime or even a lemon. This condition is called benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). As it enlarges, the prostate squeezes the urethra, causing urine to back up—first into the bladder, then into the ureters, and finally, perhaps, into the kidneys. While BPH is technically a disorder of the reproductive system, its symptoms are almost exclusively associated with urination and excretion, and therefore it is often discussed as a urinary system disorder.</p>

For the former, prostate tissue can be destroyed by applying microwaves to a specific portion of the gland. In some cases, a physician may decide to surgically remove that prostate tissue. This may be accomplished by abdominal surgery, which requires an incision of the abdomen, or access to the prostate via the urethra. This operation, called transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), requires careful consideration, because one study found that the death rate during the 5 years following TURP is much higher than that following abdominal surgery.</p>

Growth is fine during puberty, but continued growth in an adult is undesirable. These drugs contain substances that interfere with the action of the enzyme that promotes growth. One of the ingredients is an extract from a plant called the saw palmetto. It is particularly effective during the early stages of prostate enlargement. While it is sold in tablet form as an over-the-counter nutrient supplement, it should not be taken unless the need for it is confirmed by a physician. The prescription drugs finasteride (Propecia) and dutasteride (Avodart) are more powerful inhibitors of the same growth enzyme, but patients complain of erectile dysfunction and loss of libido while on the drugs.</p>

Alpha-blockers target specific receptors (called <span class="text-serif">α</span>-adrenergic receptors) on the surface of smooth muscle tissue. Tamsulosin inhibits the interaction of the nervous system with the smooth muscle, causing it to relax and promote urine flow. Similarly, drugs such as tadalafil (Cialis) inhibit an enzyme called phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) in smooth muscle tissue, causing it to relax. Like tamsulosin, the use of tadalafil causes the relaxation of the prostate, enhancing the flow of urine.</p>

BPH occurs in the inner zone of the prostate, whereas cancer tends to develop in the outer area. If prostate cancer is suspected, blood tests and a biopsy, in which a tiny sample of prostate tissue is surgically removed, will confirm the diagnosis.</p>
