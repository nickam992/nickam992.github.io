The blood must constantly be cleansed of the nitrogenous wastes, end products of metabolism. The liver produces urea, and muscles make creatinine. These wastes, as well as uric acid from the cells, are carried by the cardiovascular system to the kidneys. The urine-producing kidneys are responsible for the excretion of nitrogenous wastes. They are assisted to a limited degree by the sweat glands in the skin, which excrete perspiration, a mixture of water, salt, and some urea. In times of kidney failure, urea is excreted by the sweat glands and forms a substance called uremic frost on the skin.</p>

The kidneys are slower acting than the other two mechanisms, but they have a more powerful effect on pH. For the sake of simplicity, we can think of the kidneys as reabsorbing bicarbonate ions and excreting hydrogen ions as needed to maintain the normal pH of the blood (<a href="ch11_reader_4.xhtml#data-uuid-2d11e1f60ac74b558ac416735d56326b" class="link-inline">Fig. 11.10</a>). If the blood is acidic, hydrogen ions are excreted and bicarbonate ions are reabsorbed. If the blood is basic, hydrogen ions are not excreted and bicarbonate ions are not reabsorbed. The urine is usually acidic, so it follows that an excess of hydrogen ions is usually excreted. Ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) provides another means of buffering and removing the hydrogen ions in urine:</p>

When blood oxygen decreases, EPO increases red blood cell synthesis by stem cells in the bone marrow (see <a href="../chapter06/ch06_reader_0.xhtml" class="link-inline">Chapter 6</a>). When the concentration of red blood cells increases, blood oxygen increases also. During kidney failure, the kidneys may produce less EPO, resulting in fewer red blood cells and symptoms of fatigue. Drugs such as epoetin (Procrit) represent a form of EPO produced by genetic engineering and biotechnology (see <a href="../chapter22/ch22_reader_0.xhtml" class="link-inline">Chapter 22</a>). Like normal EPO, epoetin increases red blood cell synthesis and energy levels.
