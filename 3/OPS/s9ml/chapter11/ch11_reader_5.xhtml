Infections are also contributory. If the infection is localized in the urethra, it is called <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-urethritis"><dfn title="urethritis">urethritis</dfn></a><b>.</b> If the infection invades the urinary bladder, it is called <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-cystitis"><dfn title="cystitis">cystitis</dfn></a><b>.</b> Finally, if the kidneys are affected, the infection is called <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-pyelonephritis"><dfn title="pyelonephritis">pyelonephritis</dfn></a><b>.</b></p>

Kidney stones are hard granules made of calcium, phosphate, uric acid, and protein. Kidney stones form in the renal pelvis and usually pass unnoticed in the urine flow. If they grow to several centimeters and block the renal pelvis or ureter, a reverse pressure builds up and destroys nephrons. When a large kidney stone passes, strong contractions in a ureter can be excruciatingly painful.</p>

As described in the Health feature, “Urinalysis,” in <a href="ch11_reader_3.xhtml#data-uuid-3402b6cdb88546c3af344c499481b11e" class="link-inline">section 11.3</a>, a urinalysis can detect urine abnormalities rapidly. If damage is so extensive that more than two-thirds of the nephrons are inoperative, urea and other waste substances accumulate in the blood. This condition is called <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-uremia"><dfn title="uremia">uremia</dfn></a><b>.</b> Although nitrogenous wastes can cause serious damage, the retention of water and salts is of even greater concern. The latter causes edema, fluid accumulation in the body tissues. Imbalance in the ionic composition of body fluids can lead to loss of consciousness and heart failure.</p>

In an artificial kidney machine (<a href="ch11_reader_5.xhtml#data-uuid-7d8a684034e64105ac3c6d462e777532" class="link-inline">Fig. 11.11</a>), the patient’s blood is passed through a membranous tube that is in contact with a dialysis solution, or dialysate. Substances more concentrated in the blood diffuse into the dialysate, and substances more concentrated in the dialysate diffuse into the blood. The dialysate is continuously replaced to maintain favorable concentration gradients. In this way, the artificial kidney can be used either to extract substances from blood, including waste products or toxic chemicals and drugs, or to add substances to blood—for example, bicarbonate ions (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup>) if the blood is acidic. In the course of a 3- to 6-hour hemodialysis, 50–250 g of urea can be removed from a patient, which greatly exceeds the amount excreted by normal kidneys. Therefore, a patient needs to undergo treatment only about twice a week.</p>

A fresh amount of dialysate is introduced directly into the abdominal cavity from a bag that is temporarily attached to a permanently implanted plastic tube. The dialysate flows into the peritoneal cavity by gravity. Waste and salt molecules pass from the blood vessels in the abdominal wall into the dialysate before the fluid is collected 4 to 8 hours later. The solution is drained into a bag from the abdominal cavity by gravity, and then it is discarded. One advantage of CAPD over an artificial kidney machine is that the individual can go about his or her normal activities during CAPD.</p>

As with all organ transplants, there is the possibility of organ rejection. Receiving a kidney from a close relative has the highest chance of success. The current 1-year survival rate is 97% if the kidney is received from a relative and 90% if it is received from a nonrelative. In the future, transplantable kidneys may be created in a laboratory. Another option could be to use kidneys from specially bred pigs whose organs would not be antigenic to humans.</p>

The majority of cases (over 90%) belong to a class called autosomal dominant PKD, named after the type of mutation that causes the disease (see <a href="../chapter21/ch21_reader_0.xhtml" class="link-inline">Chapter 21</a>). Individuals with this form of PKD typically develop symptoms in their thirties and forties. The other, rarer form is called autosomal recessive PKD, and it is caused by a defect in a gene called <i>PKHD1</i>. <i>PKHD1</i> contains the instructions for the manufacture of a protein called fibrocystin, an important molecule in ensuring that the kidneys function correctly. Unfortunately for Michael and Jada, the genetic test indicated that they were both carriers for a defective copy of <i>PKHD1</i>, and that Aiesha had inherited a defective copy from both parents. Without functioning fibrocystin protein, Aiesha’s kidneys—and possibly her liver—would eventually fail as the nephrons inside her kidneys struggled to perform their function and fluid accumulated inside the cysts. The only alternative for Aiesha would be a kidney transplant. Luckily for Aiesha, kidney transplants have a 90%+ success rate, so if a compatible donor could be found, the chances of Aiesha having a healthy childhood were very good.</p>
