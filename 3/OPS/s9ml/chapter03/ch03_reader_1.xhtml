From the single-celled bacteria to plants and complex animals such as ourselves, the cell represents the fundamental unit of life. Despite their importance, most cells are small and can be seen only under a microscope. The small size of cells means that they are measured using the smaller units of the metric system, such as the <i>micrometer</i> (<span class="text-serif">μ</span>m). A micrometer is 1/1,000 millimeter (mm). The micrometer is the common unit of measurement for people who use microscopes professionally (see <a rel="jump" href="../appendix_b/appendixb_reader_0.xhtml#data-uuid-8027393bd77d4e65af1f3977f45a9beb" class="link-inline">Appendix B</a> for a complete list of metric units). </p>

The internal contents of a cell are even smaller and, in most cases, may only be viewed using powerful microscopes. Because of this small size, the <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-cell-theory"><dfn title="cell theory">cell theory</dfn></a><b>,</b> one of the fundamental principles of modern biology, was not formulated until after the invention of the microscope in the seventeenth century.</p>

Even bone (<a href="ch03_reader_1.xhtml#data-uuid-fb7dd56efe25469697bc5be753158059" class="link-inline">Fig. 3.1</a>) consists of cells surrounded by the material that they have deposited.

However, despite these differences, they all have certain structures in common. In general, it is important to recognize that the structure of a cell is directly related to its function.</p>

For example, maggots were thought to arise from meat hung in the butcher shop. Maggots often appeared in meat to which flies had access. However, people did not realize that the living maggots did not spontaneously generate from the nonliving meat. A series of experiments by Francesco Redi in the seventeenth century demonstrated that meat that was placed within sealed containers did not generate maggots. In other words, life did not generate spontaneously. In 1864, the French scientist Louis Pasteur conducted a now-classic set of experiments using bacterial cells. His experiments proved conclusively that spontaneous generation of life from nonlife is not possible.</p>

In comparison, a human egg cell is around 100 <span class="text-serif">μ</span>m in size, placing it right at the limit of what can be viewed by our eyes. However, most cells are much smaller. The small size of cells is explained by considering the <i>surface-area-to-volume ratio</i> of cells. Nutrients enter a cell—and waste exits a cell—at its surface. Therefore, the greater the amount of surface, the greater the ability to get material into and out of the cell. A large cell requires more nutrients and produces more waste than a small cell. However, as cells become smaller in volume, the proportionate amount of surface area actually increases.

There are many types of microscopes, from compound light microscopes to powerful electron microscopes. The <i>magnification,</i> or the ratio between the observed size of an image and its actual size, varies with the type of microscope. In addition, the resolution of the image varies between microscopes (<a href="ch03_reader_1.xhtml#data-uuid-d4d18914d7004d2d955915b4c054a766" class="link-inline">Table 3.1</a>). <i>Resolution</i> is the ability to distinguish between two adjacent points, and it represents the minimum distance between two objects that allows them to be seen as two different objects. Usually, the more powerful the microscope, the greater the resolution. <a href="ch03_reader_1.xhtml#data-uuid-1eaa936e291443ba89ecf6b755e6c514" class="link-inline">Figure 3.3</a> illustrates images of a red blood cell taken by three different types of microscopes.

However, this is not the case for the electron microscopes. Because electrons cannot travel very far in air, a strong vacuum must be maintained along the entire path of the electron beam. Often, cells are treated before being viewed under a microscope. Because most cells are transparent, they are often stained with colored dyes before being viewed under a light microscope. Certain cellular components take up the dye more than other components; therefore, contrast is enhanced. A similar approach is used in electron microscopy, except the sample is treated with electron-dense metals (such as gold) to provide contrast. The metals do not provide color, so electron micrographs may be colored after the micrograph is obtained. The expression “falsely colored” means that the original micrograph was colored after it was produced. In addition, during electron microscopy, cells are treated so that they do not decompose in the vacuum. Frequently, they are also embedded into a matrix, which allows a researcher to slice the cell into very thin pieces, providing cross sections of the interior of the cell.</p>

Thus, cell biologists frequently rely on dyes to produce enough contrast to resolve organelles and other cellular structures. The first of these dyes were developed in the nineteenth century from chemicals used to stain clothes in the textile industry. Since then, significant advances have occurred in the development of cellular stains.</p>

Tsien, and Osamu Shimomura—earned the Nobel Prize in Chemistry or Medicine for their work with a protein called <i>green fluorescent protein,</i> or GFP. GFP is a bioluminescent protein found in the jellyfish <i>Aequorea victoria,</i> commonly called the crystal jelly (<a href="ch03_reader_1.xhtml#data-uuid-3ec1c7a7a2274b399f0bfd81a0de527b" class="link-inline">Fig. 3A<i>a</i></a>). The crystal jelly is a native of the West Coast of the United States. Normally, this jellyfish is transparent. However, when disturbed, special cells in the jellyfish release a fluorescent protein called aequorin. Aequorin fluoresces with a green color. The research teams of Chalfie, Tsien, and Shimomura were able to isolate the fluorescent protein from the jellyfish and develop it as a molecular tag. These tags can be generated for almost any protein within the cell, revealing not only its cellular location but also how its distribution within the cell may change as a result of a response to its environment. <a href="ch03_reader_1.xhtml#data-uuid-3ec1c7a7a2274b399f0bfd81a0de527b" class="link-inline">Figure 3A<i>b</i></a> shows how a GFP-labeled antibody can be used to identify the cellular location of the actin proteins in a human cell. Actin is one of the prime components of the cell’s microfilaments, which in turn are part of the cytoskeleton of the cell. This image shows the distribution of actin in a human cell.</p>
