A nerve fiber with all the muscle fibers it innervates is called a <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-motor-unit"><dfn title="motor unit">motor unit</dfn></a><b>.</b> A motor unit operates on the principle of “all-or-none.”  Why? Because all the muscle fibers in a motor unit are stimulated at once. They all either contract or do not contract. What varies is the number of muscle fibers within a motor unit. For example, in the ocular muscles that move the eyes, the innervation ratio is one motor axon per 23 muscle fibers. By contrast, in the gastrocnemius muscle of the leg, the ratio is about one motor axon per 1,000 muscle fibers. Thus, moving the eyes requires finer control than moving the legs.</p>

This response is called a <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-muscle-twitch"><dfn title="muscle twitch">muscle twitch</dfn></a> and lasts only a fraction of a second. A muscle twitch is customarily divided into three stages. We can use our knowledge of muscle fiber contraction to understand these events. The latent period is the time between stimulation and initiation of contraction (<a href="ch13_reader_3.xhtml#data-uuid-a20c9523e24f410497b594ac108ffc0c" class="link-inline">Fig. 13.9<i>a</i></a>). During this time, we can imagine that the events that begin muscle contraction are occurring. The neurotransmitter ACh diffuses across the synaptic cleft, causing an electrical signal to spread across the sarcolemma and down the T tubules. The contraction period follows as calcium leaves the sarcoplasmic reticulum and myosin-actin cross-bridges form. As you know, the muscle shortens as it contracts. On the graph, the force increases as the muscle contracts. Finally, the relaxation period completes the muscle twitch. Myosin-actin cross-bridges are broken, and calcium returns to the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Force diminishes as the muscle returns to its former length.</p>

Tetanus continues until the muscle fatigues due to depletion of energy reserves. Fatigue is apparent when a muscle relaxes, even though stimulation continues. The tetanus of muscle cells is not the same as the infection called tetanus. The infection called tetanus is caused by the bacterium <i>Clostridium tetani.</i> Death occurs because the muscles, including the respiratory muscles, become fully contracted and do not relax.</p>

As the intensity of nervous stimulation increases, more motor units in a muscle are activated. This phenomenon is known as <i>recruitment.</i> Maximum contraction of a muscle would require that all motor units be undergoing tetanic contraction. This rarely happens, because they could all fatigue at the same time. Instead, some motor units are contracting maximally while others are resting, allowing sustained contractions to occur.</p>

If the individual is able to control the movement, even temporarily, it is called a tic. If the movement cannot be controlled, it is considered to be a twitch. No one is precisely sure what causes a tic, although its connection with medications for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been shown not to be the case. Twitches are believed to be the result of signaling problems in a specific area of the brain. The severity of both tics and twitches may be influenced by stress and sleep problems.</p>

Respiration ceases, the heart ultimately stops beating, and tissue cells begin to die. The first tissues to die are those with the highest oxygen requirement. Brain and nervous tissues have an extremely high requirement for oxygen. Deprived of oxygen, these cells typically die after only 6 minutes because of a lack of ATP. However, tissues that can produce ATP by fermentation (which does not require oxygen) can “live” for an hour or more before ATP is completely depleted. Muscle is capable of generating ATP by fermentation. Therefore, muscle cells can survive for a time after clinical death occurs. Muscle death is signaled by a process termed <i>rigor mortis,</i> the “stiffness of death” (<a href="ch13_reader_3.xhtml#data-uuid-31816a0de6e046d8b398ec5df3a38923" class="link-inline">Fig. 13B</a>).</p>

Without ATP, the muscles remain fixed in their last state of contraction. If, for example, a murder victim dies while sitting at a desk, the body in rigor mortis will be frozen in the sitting position. Rigor mortis resolves approximately 24 to 36 hours after death. Muscles lose their stiffness because lysosomes rupture. The lysosomes release enzymes that break the bonds between the muscle proteins actin and myosin.</p>

For example, the body of someone dead for 3 hours or less is still warm (close to body temperature, 98.6°F [37°C]) and rigor mortis is absent. After approximately 3 hours, the body is significantly cooler than normal and rigor mortis begins to develop. The corpse of an individual dead at least 8 hours is in full rigor mortis, and the temperature of the body is the same as the surroundings. Forensic pathologists know that a person has been dead for more than 24 hours if the body temperature is the same as the environment and there is no longer a trace of rigor mortis.</p>

Once stored ATP is used up, the cells have three ways to produce more ATP (<a href="ch13_reader_3.xhtml#data-uuid-340665586c174929ad7edcd1f5ca6d4a" class="link-inline">Fig. 13.11</a>). The three ways are (1) formation of ATP by the creatine phosphate (CP) pathway; (2) formation of ATP by fermentation; and (3) formation of ATP by cellular respiration, which involves the use of oxygen by mitochondria. Aerobic exercising depends on cellular respiration to supply ATP. Neither the CP pathway nor fermentation requires oxygen to form ATP; both are anaerobic processes.</p>

Creatine phosphate is formed only when a muscle cell is resting, and only a limited amount is stored. The CP pathway is used at the beginning of submaximal exercise and during short-term, high-intensity exercise that lasts less than 5 seconds. The energy to complete a single play in a football game comes principally from the CP system. Intense activities lasting longer than 5 seconds also make use of fermentation.</p>

Formation of lactate is noticeable because it produces short-term muscle aches and fatigue on exercising. We have all had the experience of needing to continue breathing following strenuous exercise. This continued intake of oxygen, called <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-oxygen-debt"><dfn title="oxygen debt">oxygen debt</dfn></a><b>,</b> is required, in part, to complete the metabolism of lactate and restore cells to their original energy state. The lactate is transported to the liver, where 20% of it is completely broken down to carbon dioxide and water. The ATP gained by this respiration is then used to reconvert 80% of the lactate to glucose and then glycogen. In persons who train, the number of mitochondria in individual muscles increases. There is a greater reliance on these additional mitochondria to produce ATP. Muscles rely less on fermentation as a result.</p>

However, it is also the most efficient, typically producing several dozen molecules of ATP from each food molecule. As was discussed in <a href="../chapter03/ch03_reader_0.xhtml" class="link-inline">Chapter 3</a>, cellular respiration occurs in the mitochondria. Thus, the process is aerobic and oxygen is supplied by the respiratory system. In addition, a protein called <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-myoglobin"><dfn title="myoglobin">myoglobin</dfn></a> in muscle cells delivers oxygen directly to the mitochondria. Cellular respiration can make use of glucose from the breakdown of stored muscle glycogen, glucose taken up from blood, and/or fatty acids from fat digestion (<a href="ch13_reader_3.xhtml#data-uuid-340665586c174929ad7edcd1f5ca6d4a" class="link-inline">Fig. 13.11<i>c</i></a>). Also, cellular respiration is more likely to supply ATP when exercise is submaximal in intensity. According to <a href="ch13_reader_3.xhtml#data-uuid-a20c9523e24f410497b594ac108ffc0c" class="link-inline">Figure 13.9</a>, if you are interested in exercising to lose weight, you should do so at a lower intensity and for a longer amount of time. Many exercise programs now target these levels. In effect, they are all maximizing the use of triglycerides, or fat, for making ATP by cellular respiration.</p>

However, as the temperature of the tissue rises, and the pH becomes more acidic, hemoglobin loses its ability to bind the oxygen molecules. This is where myoglobin comes in. Like hemoglobin, myoglobin binds oxygen molecules. However, myoglobin has a higher affinity (attraction) for oxygen than hemoglobin. So when you exercise, or use a muscle group, the increase in temperature causes the oxygen in the hemoglobin to be transferred to the myoglobin of the muscle cells. This allows for an efficient transfer of oxygen to those muscles that are actively contracting.<br />

However, some muscle fibers use one method more than the other to provide myofibrils with ATP. Fast-twitch fibers tend to rely on the creatine phosphate pathway and fermentation, anaerobic means of supplying ATP to muscles. Slow-twitch fibers tend to prefer cellular respiration, which is aerobic.</p>

They provide explosions of energy and are most helpful in sports activities such as sprinting, weight lifting, swinging a golf club, or throwing a shot. Fast-twitch fibers are light in color, because they have fewer mitochondria, little or no myoglobin, and fewer blood vessels than do slow-twitch fibers. Fast-twitch fibers can develop maximum tension more rapidly than slow-twitch fibers can. In addition, their maximum tension is greater. However, their dependence on anaerobic energy leaves them vulnerable to an accumulation of lactate, which causes them to fatigue quickly.</p>

They produce most of their energy aerobically, so they tire only when their fuel supply is gone. Slow-twitch fibers have many mitochondria and are dark in color, because they contain myoglobin, the respiratory pigment found in muscles (<a href="ch13_reader_3.xhtml#data-uuid-774d000aac6349f1a91d0f435a98b3c4" class="link-inline">Fig. 13.12</a>). They are also surrounded by dense capillary beds and draw more blood and oxygen than fast-twitch fibers. Slow-twitch fibers have a low maximum tension, which develops slowly, but the muscle fibers are highly resistant to fatigue. Slow-twitch fibers have a substantial reserve of glycogen and fat, so their abundant mitochondria can maintain a steady, prolonged production of ATP when oxygen is available.</p>

Muscular strength is the force a muscle group (or muscle) can exert against a resistance in one maximal effort. Muscular endurance is judged by the ability of a muscle to contract repeatedly or to sustain a contraction for an extended period. Flexibility is tested by observing the range of motion about a joint.</p>

The heart rate and capacity increase, and the air passages dilate, so that the heart and lungs are able to support prolonged muscular activity. The blood level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) increases. HDL is the molecule that slows the development of artherosclerotic plaques in blood vessels (see <a href="../chapter05/ch05_reader_0.xhtml" class="link-inline">Chapter 5</a>).

Exercise helps prevent osteoporosis, a condition in which the bones are weak and tend to break (see <a href="../chapter12/ch12_reader_0.xhtml" class="link-inline">Chapter 12</a>). Exercise promotes the activity of osteoblasts in young as well as older people. The stronger the bones when a person is young, the less chance of osteoporosis as that person ages. Exercise helps prevent weight gain, not only because the level of activity increases but also because muscles metabolize faster than other tissues. As a person becomes more muscular, the body is less likely to accumulate fat.</p>

Increasing daily activity by walking to the corner store instead of driving and by taking the stairs instead of the elevator can improve your health.</p>

It is thought that DOMS is due to tissue injury that takes several days to heal. Any movement you aren’t used to can lead to DOMS, but it is especially associated with any activity that causes muscles to contract while they are lengthening. Examples include walking down stairs, running downhill, lowering weights, and the downward motion of squats and push-ups. To prevent DOMS, try warming up thoroughly and cooling down completely. Stretch after exercising. When beginning a new activity, start gradually and build up your endurance gradually. Avoid making sudden, major changes in your exercise routine.</p>

No sport seems to be safe from drug abuse. Steroid abuse admitted by Marion Jones forever changed Olympic history. Jones was the first female athlete to win five medals for track and field events during the 2000 Sydney Olympics. In 2008, she was stripped of all medals she had earned, as well as disqualified from a fifth-place finish in the 2004 Athens games. Future Olympic record books will not include her name. The records of her teammates in the relay events have also been tainted.</p>

The exciting slugfest between Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa in the summer of 1998 was largely credited with reviving national interest in baseball. However, the great home run competition drew unwanted attention to the darker side of professional sports when it was alleged that McGwire and Sosa were using anabolic steroids at the time. Since then, players such as Jose Canseco (<a href="ch13_reader_3.xhtml#data-uuid-cb742b54b87049b98738095c2180551c" class="link-inline">Fig. 13C</a>) and McGwire have admitted using anabolic steroids to recover from baseball-related injuries. However, the controversy continues. Similar charges of drug abuse may prevent baseball great Roger Clemens from entering the Baseball Hall of Fame, despite holding the record for Cy Young awards. Likewise, because controversy continues to surround baseball legend Barry Bonds, this talented athlete may never achieve Hall of Fame status. Though he scored a record 715 home runs and won more Most Valuable Player awards than anyone in history, Bonds remains accused of steroid abuse.</p>

                However, many people from both inside and outside the industry maintain that such abuse has been going on for many years—and that it continues despite the negative publicity. Congress continues to investigate the controversy, yet the finger pointing and accusations steadily increase.</p>

Anabolic steroids are a class of steroids that generally cause tissue growth by promoting protein production. They are naturally occurring hormones created by the body and commonly used to regulate many physiological processes, from growth to sexual function. Most anabolic steroids are closely related to male sex hormones, such as testosterone. </p>
            <p id="data-uuid-cd9ea27959e744ffb8a1e3b6c4bb9cc2" data-uuid="cd9ea27959e744ffb8a1e3b6c4bb9cc2">These metabolically potent drugs are controlled substances available only by prescription under the close supervision of a physician because of their many side effects and vast potential for abuse. However, a few anabolic steroids are still legal due to loopholes in drug laws, despite being banned by most professional sports organizations.</p>
            <p id="data-uuid-327ad1fb848d47a4b740ccdc71cefc1b" data-uuid="327ad1fb848d47a4b740ccdc71cefc1b"> Anabolic steroids not only increase the number of motor units in muscle tissue, they also influence the amount of glycogen that may be synthesized. Thus, they not only increase the strength of the muscle, but the endurance due to the increased availability of glycogen. However, the use of high doses of anabolic steroids to enhance athletic performance or to increase strength, often results in serious consequences. Steroid abusers may vary the type and quantity of drug taken (called “stacking”) or may take the drugs and then stop for a time, only to resume later (called “cycling”). Stacking and cycling are done to minimize serious side effects while maximizing the desired effects of the drugs. Even so, dangerous health consequences can occur.</p>
            <h5 id="data-uuid-c0f5b97b91f54d2bb9fe2bc5a1815b96" data-uuid="c0f5b97b91f54d2bb9fe2bc5a1815b96">Dangerous Health Consequences</h5>

In women, anabolic steroid abuse may cause masculinization, including a deepened voice, excessive facial and body hair, coarsening of the hair, menstrual cycle irregularities, and enlargement of the clitoris. Anabolic steroid abuse is even more dangerous during adolescence. When taken prior to or during the teenage growth spurt, steroids may result in permanently shortened height or early onset of puberty. Ironically, whereas proper use of anabolic steroids has been helpful in treating many cases of impotence in males, abuse of these drugs may cause impotence and even shrinking of the testicles.</p>
            <p id="data-uuid-4171a3996b5c4d8cbdf5cbbffbbf8084" data-uuid="4171a3996b5c4d8cbdf5cbbffbbf8084">Perhaps the most frightening aspects of anabolic steroid abuse are the reports of increased aggressive behavior and violent mood swings. Furthermore, many users have reported extremely severe withdrawal symptoms upon quitting. Also, many anabolic steroids have been identified as “gateway drugs,” leading abusers to escalate their drug habit to more dangerous drugs, such as heroin and cocaine.</p>
