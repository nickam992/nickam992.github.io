These cats are genetic mosaics. A mosaic is formed by combining different pieces to form a whole (a stained glass window is one example). Likewise, in genetics, a mosaic is an individual whose cells have at least two—and sometimes more—different types of genetic expression. In the case of the calico cat, the fur colors are due to the expression of different genes. Some of the hair cells of these cats express the paternal copy of the gene. If an orange-haired father’s copy of the gene is activated, a patch of orange hair develops. In other cells, the maternal gene is activated. A calico kitten with a black mother will grow black patches of hair scattered among the orange. Were you aware that human females are also mosaics?</p>

One chromosome from each pair is maternal, and the other is paternal. Each of the chromosomes in the first 22 pairs resembles its mate. Further, each member of a pair contains the same genes as the other member. Sex chromosomes that determine a person’s gender are the last pair. Females have two X chromosomes, and males have one X and one Y chromosome. The Y chromosome is very small and contains far fewer genes than the X chromosome. Almost all the genes on the X chromosome lack a corresponding gene on the Y chromosome. Thus, females have two copies of X genes, whereas males have only one. The body compensates for this extra dose of genetic material by inactivating one of the X chromosomes in each cell of the female embryo. Inactivation occurs early in development (at approximately the 100-cell stage). The inactivated X chromosome is called a Barr body, named after its discoverer. Barr bodies are highly condensed chromatin that appear as dark spots in the nucleus. Which X chromosome is inactivated in a given cell appears to be random. But every cell that develops from the original group of 100 cells will have the same inactivated X chromosome as its parent cell. Some of a woman’s cells have inactivated the maternal X chromosome and other cells have inactivated the paternal X chromosome—she is a mosaic.</p>

For example, women who contain one defective copy of the breast cancer gene <i>BRCA1</i> have a greatly increased risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer. The BRCA1 protein produced from the gene is called a tumor suppressor. When the protein is functioning normally, it suppresses the development of cancer. The same protein is involved in X chromosome inactivation, although its exact role is uncertain. Presumably, increased cancer risk occurs because abnormal BRCA1 protein can neither inactivate the X chromosome nor function as a tumor suppressor.</p>

This is most likely the reason that a zygote with one X chromosome (Turner syndrome) can survive. Then, too, all extra X chromosomes beyond a single one become Barr bodies; this explains why poly-X females and XXY males are seen fairly frequently. An extra Y chromosome, called Jacobs syndrome, is tolerated in humans, most likely because the Y chromosome carries few genes. Jacobs syndrome (XYY) is due to nondisjunction during meiosis II of spermatogenesis. We know this because two Ys are present only during meiosis II in males.</p>

Persons with Down syndrome usually have three copies of chromosome 21, because the egg had two copies instead of one. However, about 20% of the time the sperm contributes the extra chromosome 21. The chances of a woman having a Down syndrome child increase rapidly with age, starting at about age 40. The reasons for this are still being investigated.</p>

Karyotyping can detect a Down syndrome child. However, young women are not routinely encouraged to undergo the procedures necessary to get a sample of fetal cells (amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling), because the risk of complications is greater than the risk of having a Down syndrome child. Fortunately, a test based on substances in maternal blood can help identify fetuses who may need to be karyotyped.</p>

Following puberty, males produce sperm continuously throughout their lives. In contrast, meiosis for females begins about 5 months after being conceived. However, the process is paused at prophase I of meiosis. Only after puberty are a selected few number of these cells allowed to continue meiosis as part of the female menstrual cycle. Because long periods of time may occur between the start and completion of meiosis, there is a greater chance that nondisjunction will occur; thus, as a female ages, there is a greater chance of producing a child with Down syndrome.</p>

Extensive investigative work has been directed toward discovering the specific genes responsible for the characteristics of the syndrome. Thus far, investigators have discovered several genes that may account for various conditions seen in persons with Down syndrome. For example, they have located genes most likely responsible for the increased tendency toward leukemia, cataracts, accelerated rate of aging, and intellectual disabilities. The gene associated with the intellectual disabilities, called the <i>Gart</i> gene, causes an increased level of purines in the blood, a finding associated with problems in intellectual development. One day, it may be possible to control the expression of the <i>Gart</i> gene even before birth, so that at least this symptom of Down syndrome does not appear.</p>

She had been undergoing routine mammograms since age 30, so the cancer was caught at an early stage. However, most women may be unaware that they carry the mutated <i>BRCA1</i> gene. A blood test can easily screen for mutations in the <i>BRCA1</i> gene. Depending on the mutation, age of the patient, and health history of the patient, a genetics counselor can advise on the probability of breast or ovarian cancer in the future. In Christina’s case, she made the decision to have a double mastectomy, removing both breasts even though the tumor was located in only one, instead of undergoing longer-term treatment, such as chemotherapy. The next chapter will explore some of the options that cancer patients, such as Christina, face when they learn that they carry a potentially dangerous combination of alleles that makes them susceptible to cancer.</p>
