To do this, meiosis involves two consecutive cell divisions, without an intervening interphase. The end result is four daughter cells, each of which has one of each type of chromosome and, therefore, half as many chromosomes as the parent cell. The parent cell has the diploid (2n) number of chromosomes; the daughter cells have half this number, called the <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-haploid-n"><dfn title="haploid (n)">haploid <em>(</em>n<em>)</em></dfn></a> number of chromosomes. In addition, meiosis introduces genetic variation, which means that each of the resulting daughter cells is not a genetic replicate of the parent cell but, rather, possesses new combinations of the genetic material. In animals, including humans, the daughter cells that result from meiosis may go on to become the gametes.</p>

Secondary spermatocytes divide during meiosis II to produce four <i>spermatids,</i> which are also haploid (n).

The chromosomes in secondary spermatocytes are duplicated and consist of two chromatids, whereas those in spermatids consist of only one. Spermatids mature into sperm (spermatozoa). In human males, sperm have 23 chromosomes, the haploid number. The process of meiosis in males always results in four cells that become sperm. In other words, all four daughter cellsâ€”the spermatidsâ€”become sperm.</p>

Binary fission is a quick and easy way to asexually reproduce many organisms within a short time. A bacterium can increase to over 1 million cells in about 7 hours, for example. Then, why do organisms expend the energy to reproduce sexually? It takes energy to find a mate, carry out a courtship, and produce eggs or sperm that may never be used for reproductive purposes. A human male produces over 400 million sperm per day, and very few of these will fertilize an egg.</p>

Genetic recombination ensures that offspring will be genetically different from each other and their parents. Genetic recombination occurs because of crossing-over and independent alignment of chromosomes. Also, at the time of fertilization, parents contribute genetically different chromosomes to the offspring.</p>

Those individuals able to survive in a new environment are able to pass on their genes. Environments are subject to change, so sexual reproduction is advantageous. It generates the diversity needed, so that at least a few will be suited to new and different environmental circumstances.</p>
