        <p id="data-uuid-8ba3a9f5ff474a1594fb6c5923e2548f" data-uuid="8ba3a9f5ff474a1594fb6c5923e2548f">Genetics in the twenty-first century concerns genomics, the study of genomes—our genes and the genes of other organisms. The Human Genome Project (HGP), whose purpose was to sequence the human genome, was completed in 2003 through a coordinated effort by the U.S. government and private laboratories and contributions from many other countries, such as France, Japan, China, and Germany.  During the 13-year study, many interesting facts emerged. The human genome contains approximately 3.4 billion bases, and 99.9% of these bases are identical in sequence in all humans. The average functional gene contains only about 3,000 bases; the number of functional genes in humans is estimated to be around 23,000, surprisingly low from the beginning estimate of 80,000 to 140,000 genes. These data were obtained through the use of advanced biotechnology, including PCR, electrophoresis, and DNA sequencing. A surprising finding has been that genome size is not proportionate to the number of genes and does not correlate to the complexity of the organism. The flowering plant <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> has a genome size of 125 million bases and 25,500 coding genes. The common house mouse, <i>Mus musculus,</i> has a genome of 2.8 billion bases and about 23,000 coding genes. When scientists first completed the DNA sequence of the human genome, they made an estimate of the number of genes based on sequences that appeared to encode proteins. Researchers were surprised to find fewer than 23,000 genes in the human genome. Less than 2% of the entire human genome codes for functional proteins. Research suggests that these areas of the genome may produce RNA molecules that play an important role in gene regulation.</p>

It is hoped that this type of study, called <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-functional-genomics"><dfn title="functional genomics">functional genomics</dfn></a><b>,</b> will also discover the role of noncoding regions. Genes make up less than 2% of the human genome, and scientists in the field of genomics are working hard to find the function of the many intergenic DNA sequences.</p>

In one study, researchers compared our genome to that of chromosome 22 in chimpanzees (<a href="ch22_reader_4.xhtml#data-uuid-b6380cb6bde742e585edd76eb42bddf5" class="link-inline">Fig. 22.22</a>). They found three types of genes of particular interest: a gene for proper speech development, several for hearing, and several for smell. Genes necessary for speech development are thought to have played an important role in human evolution. You can suppose that changes in hearing may also have facilitated using language for communication between people. To explain differences in smell genes, investigators speculated that the olfaction genes may have affected dietary changes or sexual selection. Or they may have been involved in other traits, rather than just smell. The researchers who did this study were surprised to find that many of the other genes they located and studied are known to cause human diseases. They wondered if comparing genomes would be a way of finding other genes associated with human diseases. Investigators are taking all sorts of avenues to link human base sequence differences to illnesses.</p>

Researchers weren’t surprised to learn that the base sequence of chimpanzees and humans is 95–98% alike. However, they didn’t expect to find that our sequence is also 85% similar to that of a mouse, for example. So the quest is on to discover how the regulation of genes explains why we have one set of traits and mice have another set, despite the similarity of our base sequences. One possibility is alternative gene splicing. We may differ from mice in the types of proteins we manufacture and/or by when and where certain proteins are present.</p>

Many of our genes are translated into proteins at some time, in some of our cells. The translation of all coding genes results in a collection of proteins called the human proteome. The analysis of proteomes is more challenging than the analysis of genomes. A single gene can code for more than 1,000 different proteins, and protein concentrations can differ widely in cells. Researchers have to be able to identify proteins, regardless of whether there is one or thousands of copies of a protein in a cell. Any particular protein differs minute by minute in concentration, interactions, cellular location, and chemical modifications, among other features. But to understand a protein, all these features must be analyzed. Computer modeling of the three-dimensional shape of cellular proteins is an important part of proteomics. The study of cellular proteins and how they function is essential to understanding the causes of certain diseases and disorders. This study is also important in the discovery of better drugs, because most drugs are proteins or molecules that affect the function of proteins.</p>

Specifically, it is the process of creating databases of information, then mapping and analyzing the information gained from DNA sequencing and proteomics. Genomics and proteomics produce raw data. These fields depend on computer analysis to find significant patterns in the data. As a result of bioinformatics, scientists hope to find cause-and-effect relationships between various genetic profiles and genetic disorders caused by multifactorial genes. By correlating any sequence changes with resulting phenotypes, one current focus of bioinformatics research is discovering if noncoding regions of the genome do have functions and, if so, what effect those functions may have on homeostasis.</p>

These children lack the enzyme adenosine deaminase (ADA), which is involved in the maturation of T and B cells. To carry out ex vivo gene therapy, stem cells are removed from bone marrow. These cells are mixed with a normal gene for the enzyme that is contained in a vector, or “carrier” molecule. The most successful vectors are viruses that have been altered for safety. The combined cells are then returned to the patient. Bone marrow stem cells are preferred for this procedure because they divide to produce more cells with the same genes. SCID patients who have undergone this procedure show significantly improved immune function and a sustained rise in ADA enzyme activity in the blood. Ex vivo gene therapy has also been proven effective for hemophilia A, Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, Crohn’s disease, and certain cancers.</p>

They often suffer from numerous and potentially deadly infections of the respiratory tract. For in vivo gene therapy, the therapeutic DNA is injected straight into the body cells. As in ex vivo therapy, the use of a vector is needed. For in vivo therapy, a retrovirus or an adenovirus is used as the vector that carries the corrective gene. For CF patients, the adenovirus with the functioning gene is either sprayed into the nose or injected into the lower respiratory tract. This type of gene therapy is minimally invasive and has quick results, but the effects are not as long lasting as ex vivo therapy. In vivo gene therapy has been used for cardiovascular diseases, endocrine disorders, and Huntington disease.</p>

In this instance, the chip contains genomic DNA that is cut into fragments. Each spot on the microarray corresponds to a known chromosomal location. Labeled genomic DNA from diseased tissues and control tissues bind to the DNA on the chip, and the relative fluorescence from both dyes is determined. If the number of copies of any particular target DNA has increased, more sample DNA will bind to that spot on the microarray relative to the control DNA, and a difference in fluorescence of the two dyes will be detected.</p>

Weber explained that insulin for diabetes patients has been made since the late 1970s in large vats called bioreactors. A non-disease-producing strain of <i>Escherichia coli</i> has been made that contains the human gene for the production of insulin through recombinant DNA technology. In the bioreactor with the recombinant cells is also a medium that contains a food source for the bacteria. The bacteria stay alive and make billions of copies of themselves, while at the same time producing human insulin. The insulin is retrieved from the medium and used for injections. Insulin lispro (Humalog) and insulin human recombinant (Humulin N) are two very common types of medical insulin made in this manner. Kaya will have to monitor her blood sugar level several times per day using a glucose meter and, when appropriate, give herself injections of insulin to help regulate her levels. Insulin is injected because if it were in pill form and used orally, it would be inactivated by the digestive system. Instead, insulin is administered by intramuscular injection so that it can enter directly into the bloodstream. Advances in the treatment of diabetes have also included the use of an insulin pump. The pump is a small device worn on a belt or pocket that delivers fast-acting insulin into the body via an infusion set—a thin plastic tube ending in a small, flexible plastic cannula, or a very thin needle. The cannula is inserted beneath the skin at the infusion site, usually in the person’s abdomen or upper buttocks. The infusion set is in place for 2 to 3 days (sometimes more), and then it is moved to a new location. The insulin pump is not an artificial pancreas; it is a computer-driven device that delivers fast-acting insulin in precise amounts at preprogrammed times. Under her doctor’s supervision, Kaya will monitor her diabetes to discover the appropriate treatment options for her lifestyle and medical needs.</p>
