DNA sequencing allows researchers to identify specific alleles that are associated with a disease and thus facilitate the development of medicines or treatments. This information also serves as the foundation for the study of forensic biology and even contributes to our understanding of our evolutionary history (see <a href="../chapter23/ch23_reader_0.xhtml" class="link-inline">Chapter 23</a>).</p>

Modern-day sequencing involves dyes attached to the nucleotides and use of a laser to detect the different dyes by an automated sequencing machine, which shows the order of nucleotides on a grid computer screen (<a href="ch22_reader_3.xhtml#data-uuid-e517aad7c1624f1c8bb2123f6a3654ef" class="link-inline">Fig. 22.14</a>).

PCR is very specific—it <i>amplifies</i> (makes copies of) a targeted DNA sequence, usually a few hundred bases in length. PCR requires the use of DNA polymerase, the enzyme that carries out DNA replication, and a supply of nucleotides for the new DNA strands. PCR involves three basic steps (<a href="ch22_reader_3.xhtml#data-uuid-ff2fbdd380be4ef39bf0d25e6784f35f" class="link-inline">Fig. 22.15</a>), which occur repeatedly, usually for about 35 to 40 cycles: (1) a denaturation step at 95°C, in which DNA is heated to become single-stranded; (2) an annealing step at a temperature usually between 50° and 60°C, in which an oligonucleotide primer hybridizes to each of the single DNA strands; and (3) an extension step at 72°C, in which an engineered DNA polymerase adds complementary bases to each of the single DNA strands, creating double-stranded DNA.</p>

Notice that the amount of DNA doubles with each replication cycle. Thus, assuming you start with only one copy of DNA, after one cycle you will have two copies, after two cycles four copies, and so on. PCR has been in use since its development in 1985 by Kary Banks Mullis, and now almost every laboratory has automated PCR machines to carry out the procedure. Automation became possible after a temperature-insensitive (thermostable) DNA polymerase was extracted from the bacterium <i>Thermus aquaticus</i><i>,</i> which lives in hot springs. The enzyme can withstand the high temperature used to denature double-stranded DNA. Therefore, replication does not have to be interrupted by the need to add more enzyme. Only a small amount of DNA is required for PCR to be effective, so it has even been possible to sequence DNA from the tiniest sample at a crime scene or from mummified human brains.</p>

Today, DNA fingerprinting is often carried out by detecting how many times a short sequence (two to five bases) is repeated. Organisms differ by how many repeats they have at particular locations. Recall that PCR amplifies only particular portions of the DNA. Therefore, the greater the number of repeats at a location, the longer the section of DNA amplified by PCR. During a process called gel electrophoresis, these DNA fragments can be separated according to their size; the result is a pattern of distinctive bands. If two DNA patterns match, there is a high probability that the DNA came from the same source. It is customary to test for the number of repeats at several locations to further define the source.</p>

The opportunity now arises to use DNA fingerprinting in the same way. DNA fingerprinting requires only a small DNA sample, which can come from blood left at the scene of the crime, semen from a rape case, or even a single hair root!</p>
            <p id="data-uuid-f6cfda19fabe43c7a9e74b868608a30d" data-uuid="f6cfda19fabe43c7a9e74b868608a30d">Advocates of DNA fingerprinting claim that identification is “beyond a reasonable doubt.” But how can investigators be certain? Much of the forensic DNA fingerprinting done today uses short tandem repeats (STRs)—stretches of noncoding DNA in our genome that contain repeated DNA sequences. Most commonly, these repeats are four bases in length—for example, CATG. You may have 11 copies of this repeat on a particular chromosome inherited from your father and only 3 copies on the homologous chromosome from your mother. When analyzed by electrophoresis, greater numbers of repeats correspond to increasing lengths on the DNA. People have unique repeat patterns, so these STRs can be used to discriminate between individuals. A particular STR pattern on a single chromosome may be shared by a number of people. However, by studying multiple STR sites, a statistically unique pattern can be developed for everyone—unless you share your DNA with an identical twin! In the United States, the FBI’s Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) uses 13 STR sites (plus a marker for sex) to identify individuals.</p>

Police or laboratory negligence can invalidate the evidence. For example, during the O. J. Simpson trial, the defense claimed that the DNA evidence was inadmissible because it could not be proven that the police had not “planted” O. J.’s blood at the crime scene. There have also been reported problems with sloppy laboratory procedures and the credibility of forensic experts. In one case, Curtis McCarty had been placed on death row three times by the same prosecutor and police lab analyst. After 21 years in prison, he was exonerated. The prosecutor has been accused of misconduct, and the police lab analyst was fired for falsifying laboratory data to obtain convictions.</p>

Most labs will look at 12 to 16 different chromosomal markers to identify paternity, and results are ready in about 3 to 5 days. Although efficient, private, and quick, these home test results are not approved by the court system as evidence.</p>

                <span class="caption-body">This figure shows the basic steps in the cloning of a human gene. Human DNA and plasmid DNA are cleaved by a specific type of restriction enzyme. Then the human DNA, perhaps containing the insulin gene, is spliced into a plasmid by the enzyme DNA ligase. Gene cloning is achieved after a bacterium takes up the plasmid. If the gene functions normally as expected, the product (e.g., insulin) may also be retrieved.<span> </span></span></figcaption>

Hundreds of restriction enzymes occur naturally in bacteria, where they cut up any viral DNA that enters the cell. They are called <i>restriction</i> enzymes<i>,</i> because they restrict the growth of viruses. They also act as molecular scissors to cleave any piece of DNA at a specific site. For example, the restriction enzyme called <i>Eco</i>RI always cuts double-stranded DNA at this sequence of bases and in this manner:</p>

To ensure this, it is only necessary to use the same type of restriction enzyme to cleave both human DNA containing the gene for insulin and plasmid DNA.</p>
        <p id="data-uuid-936f96a76ba149a48fbfd63bb1c5f265" data-uuid="936f96a76ba149a48fbfd63bb1c5f265">Next, an enzyme called <i>DNA ligase</i> is used to seal foreign DNA into the opening created in the plasmid. The single-stranded but complementary ends of a cleaved DNA molecule are called “sticky ends.” This is because they can bind a piece of DNA by complementary base pairing. Sticky ends facilitate the sealing of the plasmid DNA with human DNA for the insulin gene. Now the vector is complete, and an rDNA molecule has been prepared.</p>

Gene cloning occurs as the plasmid replicates on its own. Scientists clone genes for a number of reasons. They might want to determine the difference in base sequence between a normal gene and a mutated gene. Or they might use the genes to genetically modify organisms in a beneficial way.</p>

For a human gene to express itself in a bacterium, the gene has to be accompanied by regulatory regions unique to bacteria. Also, the gene should not contain introns, because bacteria don’t have introns. However, it is possible to make a human gene that lacks introns. The enzyme called reverse transcriptase can be used to make a DNA copy of mRNA. The DNA molecule, called <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-complementary-DNA-cDNA"><dfn title="complementary DNA (cDNA)">complementary DNA <em>(</em>cDNA<em>)</em></dfn></a>, does not contain introns. In this manner, the recombinant cells make many copies of themselves containing the new gene through mitosis, and each new cell will make the product coded for by the new gene.</p>

In addition to the gene cloning shown in <a href="ch22_reader_3.xhtml#data-uuid-b756efa1c9174d31851efa7ae18e0486" class="link-inline">Figure 22.17</a>, there is reproductive cloning—the ability to clone an adult animal from a normal body cell—and therapeutic cloning, which allows the rapid production of mature cells of a specific type. Both types of cloning are a direct result of recent discoveries about how the cell cycle is controlled.</p>

The donor cells were starved before the cell’s nucleus was placed in an enucleated egg. This caused them to stop dividing and go into a G<sub>0</sub> (resting) stage, and this made the nuclei amenable to cytoplasmic signals for initiation of development (<a href="ch22_reader_3.xhtml#data-uuid-9eb8ff402ced4313a6dd9b65c60c0167" class="link-inline">Fig. 22B<i>a</i></a>). This advance has made it possible to clone all sorts of farm animals that have desirable traits and even to clone rare animals that might otherwise become extinct. Despite the encouraging results, however, there are still obstacles to be overcome, and a ban on the use of federal funds in experiments to clone humans remains firmly in place.<span> </span></p>

In 2006, by adding just four genes to adult skin stem cells, Japanese scientists were able to coax the cells, called fibroblasts, into becoming induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS), a type of stem cell that is similar to an ESC. The researchers were then able to create heart and brain cells from the adult stem cells. Other researchers have used this technique to reverse Parkinson-like symptoms in rats. </p>

First, scientists identified a gene coding for a protein that transports salt ions (Na<sup>+</sup>) across the vacuole membrane. Sequestering the salt ions in a vacuole prevents them from interfering with plant metabolism. Then, the scientists cloned the gene and used it to genetically engineer plants that overproduce the channel protein. The modified plants thrived when watered with a salty solution. Today, crop production is limited by the effects of salinization on about 50% of irrigated lands. Salt-tolerant crops would increase yield on this land. Salt-, and drought-, and cold-tolerant crops might help provide enough food for a world population that may nearly double by 2050.</p>

About 170 years ago, it was responsible for the Irish potato famine, which caused the death of millions of people. By placing a gene from a naturally blight-resistant wild potato into a farmed variety, researchers have now made potato plants that are no longer vulnerable to a range of blight strains. Some progress has also been made in increasing the food quality of crops. Soybeans have been developed that mainly produce the monounsaturated fatty acid oleic acid, a change that may improve human health.</p>

Leaves can be engineered to lose less water and take in more carbon dioxide. This type of modification helps a range of crops grow successfully in various climates, including those that are more drought-susceptible or have a higher average temperature than the normal growing climate. Other single-gene modifications allow plants to produce various products, including human hormones, clotting factors, antibodies, and vaccines.</p>

It is possible to microinject foreign genes into eggs by hand. Another method uses vortex mixing. The eggs are placed in an agitator with DNA and silicon carbide needles, and the needles make tiny holes through which the DNA can enter. When these eggs are fertilized, the resulting offspring are transgenic animals. Using this technique, many types of animal eggs have taken up the gene for bovine growth hormone (BGH). The procedure has been used to produce larger fish, cows, pigs, rabbits, and sheep. Pigs that are bred to supply transplant organs for humans can be genetically modified in this manner also.</p>

Genes that code for therapeutic and diagnostic proteins are incorporated into an animal’s DNA, and the proteins appear in the animal’s milk (<a href="ch22_reader_3.xhtml#data-uuid-8e0ff85db7474000bb0672cc99c26812" class="link-inline">Fig. 22.21</a>). Plans are under way to produce drugs for the treatment of cystic fibrosis, cancer, blood diseases, and other disorders by this method. <a href="ch22_reader_3.xhtml#data-uuid-8e0ff85db7474000bb0672cc99c26812" class="link-inline">Figure 22.21</a> outlines the procedure for producing transgenic animals. The gene of interest is microinjected into donor eggs. Following in vitro fertilization, the zygotes are placed in host females, where they develop. After transgenic female offspring mature, the product is secreted in their milk. Then, cloning can be used to produce many animals that produce the same product. Female clones produce the same product in their milk. This technique has been beneficial in producing milk with certain antibiotics or vaccines, in addition to milk with a higher nutritional value.</p>

An allele such as the one that causes cystic fibrosis can be cloned and inserted into mice embryonic stem cells. Occasionally, a mouse embryo homozygous for cystic fibrosis will result. This embryo develops into a mutant mouse that has a phenotype similar to a human with cystic fibrosis. New drugs for the treatment of cystic fibrosis can then be tested in these mice. The same scenario is seen in the OncoMouse, which carries genes for the development of cancer.</p>

Currently, an estimated 300,000 plus patients worldwide are in need of organ transplants. Human donors are hard to match and in most cases not available. Scientists have chosen to use the pig because knowledge of pig breeding has a long history in animal husbandry and most pig organs match the size and structure of human organs. Additionally, the ability of pigs to express genes for human-recognition proteins means that pig organs will be more readily accepted by humans and rejection will be less likely to occur.</p>
