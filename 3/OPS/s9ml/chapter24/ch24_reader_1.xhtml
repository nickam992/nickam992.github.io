Temperature and rainfall levels define the biomes. A variety of organisms adapted to the regional climate characterize each biome. The tropical rain forest, which occurs at the equator, is dominated by large, evergreen, broad-leaved trees. The savanna is a tropical grassland that supports many types of grazing animals. Temperate grasslands receive less rainfall than temperate forests (where many trees lose their leaves during the winter). Deserts receive scant rainfall and therefore lack trees. The taiga is a very cold northern forest of conifers such as pine, spruce, hemlock, and fir. Bordering the North Pole is the frigid tundra, which has long winters and a short growing season. A permafrost persists even during the summer in the tundra and prevents large plants from becoming established.</p>

One of these phenomena is energy flow, which begins when producers absorb solar (and in some cases, chemical) energy. The second, nutrient cycling, occurs when producers take in inorganic chemicals from the physical environment. Thereafter, producers make organic nutrients that can be used by them as well as by the other populations of the ecosystem. Energy flow occurs when nutrients pass from one population to another. Eventually, all the energy content is converted to heat. The heat then dissipates into the environment. Therefore, most ecosystems cannot exist without a continual supply of solar energy.

Similarly, only a small percentage of nutrients taken in by heterotrophs is available to higher-level consumers. <a href="ch24_reader_1.xhtml#data-uuid-2774e639c29647d8a06318d3e2b46235" class="link-inline">Figure 24.5</a> shows why. Some of the food eaten by an herbivore is never digested and is eliminated as feces. Metabolic wastes are excreted in urine. Of the assimilated energy, a large portion is used during metabolism and thereafter becomes heat. Only the remaining food energy, converted into increased body weight (or additional offspring), becomes available to carnivores. Plants carry on cellular respiration, too, so only about 55% of the original energy absorbed by plants is available to an ecosystem. Further, as organisms feed on one another, less and less of this 55% is available in a usable form.</p>

Instead, they are nutrients made available to decomposers. Decomposers convert organic nutrients, such as glucose, back into inorganic chemicals, such as carbon dioxide and water. The inorganic chemicals are then released to the soil or atmosphere. Chemicals complete their cycle in an ecosystem when the producers absorb inorganic chemicals from the atmosphere or soil.</p>

Studies show that fish and wildlife exposed to mercury emissions are negatively impacted. Humans are impacted if they come into contact with affected fish and wildlife. Recent fish studies have shown a widespread contamination of mercury in streams, wetlands, reservoirs, and lakes throughout the majority of the United States.</p>

Bioaccumulation occurs when an organism accumulates a contaminant faster than it can eliminate it. Most organisms can eliminate about half the mercury in their bodies every 70 days if they can avoid ingesting any additional mercury during this time. Problems arise when organisms cannot eliminate the mercury before they ingest more.</p>

Methylmercury is the form that leads to health problems such as sterility in men, damage to the central nervous system, and in severe cases, birth defects in infants. Developing fetuses and children can have health consequences from intake levels five to ten times lower than adults.</p>

Research conducted in the northeastern United States and Canada showed the presence of mercury in a variety of birds ranging from thrushes to loons to bald eagles. It is no surprise that loons and bald eagles can have high levels of mercury accumulation due to their consumption of contaminated fish. It was the presence of mercury in the songbirds that raised serious concerns among ecologists. Some speculate that northeastern songbirds are ingesting mercury when they feed on insects that have picked up the toxin from eating smaller insects that ingested it from vegetation. This raises concerns about mercury’s ability to enter food webs and bioaccumulate in previously unknown ways.</p>

Every ecosystem on the planet has some degree of exposure to this pollutant, and with this exposure comes the risk of mercury contamination. Studies on species ranging from polar bears and bald eagles to whales and sharks show us that there are no limits to where mercury can be found. With coal-burning power plants being the largest human-caused source of mercury emissions, it will be up to us to find a solution to this global problem.</p>
