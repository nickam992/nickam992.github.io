This is called “groundwater mining.” In these locations, the groundwater is dropping. Residents may run out of groundwater, at least for irrigation purposes, within a few years. Freshwater, which makes up only about 3% of the world’s supply of water, is called a renewable resource, because a new supply is always being produced. However, it is possible to run out of freshwater when the available supply runs off instead of entering bodies of freshwater and aquifers. Freshwater may also become so polluted that it is not usable.</p>

On land, plants take up carbon dioxide from the air. Through photosynthesis, they incorporate carbon into nutrients used by autotrophs and heterotrophs. When organisms, including plants, conduct cellular respiration, carbon is returned to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide. Therefore, carbon dioxide recycles to plants by way of the atmosphere.</p>

Producers take in carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and convert it to organic molecules that feed all organisms. The transfer rate of carbon into the atmosphere due to respiration approximately matches the rate due to withdrawal by plants for photosynthesis. Fossil fuels arise when organisms die but do not decompose. When humans burn fossil fuels and destroy vegetation (purple arrows), more carbon dioxide is added to the atmosphere than is withdrawn. This causes environmental pollution.</span>

Carbon dioxide from the air combines with water to produce bicarbonate ion (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>).

This increase is largely due to the burning of fossil fuels and the destruction of forests to make way for farmland and pasture. When we do away with forests, we reduce a reservoir and lose the organisms that take up excess carbon dioxide.

It is predicted that, as the oceans warm, temperatures in the polar regions will rise to a greater degree than in other regions. As a result, sea levels will rise, because glaciers will melt, and water expands as it warms. Water evaporation will increase, and most likely there will be increased rainfall along the coasts and dryer conditions inland. The occurrence of droughts will reduce agricultural yields and cause trees to die off. Expansion of forests into Arctic areas might not offset the loss of forests in the temperate zones. Coastal agricultural lands, such as the deltas of Bangladesh and China, will be inundated with water. Billions of dollars will have to be spent to keep coastal cities such as New Orleans, New York, Boston, Miami, and Galveston from disappearing into the sea.</p>

Some of this soil becomes available to plants, which then incorporate phosphate into a variety of molecules.

Aquatic food chains are more likely to experience biological magnification, because there are more links than in a terrestrial food chain. Mercury levels can be high in some of the fish we eat (top consumers like shark, swordfish, and tuna) for this reason.</p>

Waste dumping occurs at sea. However, ocean currents sometimes transport both trash and pollutants back to shore. Offshore mining and shipping add pollutants to the oceans. Some 5 million metric tons of oil a year end up in the oceans. Large oil spills kill plankton, fish, and shellfishes, as well as birds and marine mammals.</p>

Fisheries once rich and diverse, such as George’s Bank off the coast of New England, are in severe decline. Haddock was once the most abundant species in this fishery, but now it accounts for less than 2% of the total catch. Cod and bluefin tuna have suffered a 90% reduction in population size. In warm, tropical regions, many areas of coral reefs are now overgrown with algae. This is because the fish that normally keep the algae under control have been overharvested.</p>

                Yellowstone, scientists had to piece together information on the
                evolutionary history of the organisms in the community with an
                understanding of how the ecosystem functions as a biological system.
                Coupled with this was some fascinating detective work, with experimental
                results suggesting that it was the demise of the wolves, not other
                ecological factors, that was responsible.</p>

                reintroducing wolves into Yellowstone in the late 1990s and
                closely monitoring not only the health of the wolf population but also
                the size and composition of the elk herds, conservation ecologists have
                been able to document that the Yellowstone ecosystem is beginning to
                return to a healthy status.</p>
