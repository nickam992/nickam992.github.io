Therefore, rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells, are more susceptible to its effects than other cells. Powerful X-rays or gamma rays can be administered through an externally applied beam. In some instances, tiny radioactive sources can be implanted directly into the patient’s body. Cancer of the cervix and larynx, early stages of prostate cancer, and Hodgkin disease are often treated with radiation therapy alone.</p>

Weakness and fatigue are very typical. Dry mouth, nausea, and diarrhea often affect the digestive tract. Dry, red, or irritated skin or even blistering burns may occur at the treatment site. Hair loss at the treatment site, which in some situations can be permanent, can be very depressing to the patient. Fortunately, most side effects of radiation treatment are temporary.</p>

Unlike radiation, which treats only the part of the body exposed to the radiation, chemotherapy treats the entire body. As a result, any cells that may have escaped from where the cancer originated are treated. Most chemotherapeutic drugs kill cells by damaging their DNA or interfering with DNA synthesis. The hope is that all cancer cells will be killed, while leaving enough normal cells untouched to allow the body to keep functioning. Combining drugs that have different actions at the cellular level may help destroy a greater number of cancer cells. Combinations may also reduce the risk of the cancer developing resistance to one particular drug. What chemicals are used is generally based on the type of cancer and the patient’s age, general health, and perceived ability to tolerate potential side effects. Some of the types of chemotherapy medications commonly used to treat cancer include the following:</p>

For example, in some cancers, a small portion of chromosome 9 is missing. Therefore, DNA metabolism differs in the cancerous cells compared with normal cells. Specific chemotherapy for the cancer can exploit this metabolic difference and destroy the cancerous cells.</p>

Paclitaxel interferes with microtubules needed for cell division. Now, chemists have synthesized a family of related drugs, called taxoids, which may be more powerful and have fewer side effects than paclitaxel.</p>

The survival rate for children with childhood leukemia is 80%. Hodgkin disease, a lymphoma, once killed two out of three patients. Combination therapy, using four different drugs, can now wipe out the disease in a matter of months. Three out of four patients achieve a cure, even when the cancer is not diagnosed immediately. In other cancers—most notably, breast and colon cancer—chemotherapy can reduce the chance of recurrence after surgery has removed all detectable traces of the disease.</p>

Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss and hair loss, anxiety and/or depression, and extreme fatigue are common symptoms that may be caused by chemotherapy or radiation therapy. However, strategies now exist to help sufferers deal with treatment side effects, and others continue to be devised. Antiemetic drugs alleviate nausea and vomiting. Genetically engineered erythropoietin helps stimulate red blood cell production and reduce fatigue (see <a href="../chapter06/ch06_reader_0.xhtml" class="link-inline">Chapter 6</a>). Dronabinol (Marinol), a medication closely related to marijuana, stimulates appetite and helps with weight loss. Hair loss can be minimized by cryotherapy, which involves applying cold packs on the scalp during a treatment. Cold temperatures slow the metabolic rate of hair follicles, and more follicles survive treatment. Antidepressants and antianxiety medications help the patient deal with the psychological effects of the disease.</p>

Calming techniques, including yoga, meditation, and tai chi, help the sufferer relax. Hypnosis can have the same restful effect. Aromatherapy, massage therapy, and music therapy seem to ease tension and stress, perhaps by stimulating pleasure centers in the brain. Exercise is known to produce endorphins, the brain’s pain-relieving neurotransmitters (see <a href="../chapter14/ch14_reader_0.xhtml" class="link-inline">Chapter 14</a>).</p>

This occurs because a plasma membrane carrier pumps the drug (or drugs) out of the cancer cell before it can be harmed. Researchers are testing drugs known to poison the pump in an effort to restore the effectiveness of the drugs. Another possibility is to use combinations of drugs with different toxic activities, because cancer cells can’t become resistant to many different types at once.</p>
        <p id="data-uuid-6bd2bea05a9e4961b9c0f63bb21418f6" data-uuid="6bd2bea05a9e4961b9c0f63bb21418f6"><i>Bone marrow transplants</i> are sometimes done in conjunction with chemotherapy. The red bone marrow contains large populations of dividing cells. Therefore, red bone marrow is particularly prone to destruction by chemotherapeutic drugs. In bone marrow autotransplantation, a patient’s stem cells are harvested and stored before chemotherapy begins. High doses of radiation or chemotherapeutic drugs are then given within a relatively short time. This prevents multidrug resistance from occurring, and the treatment is more likely to catch every cancer cell. The stored stem cells can then be returned to the patient by injection. They automatically make their way to bony cavities, where they resume blood cell formation.</p>

However, in many cases the cancer cells are able to avoid the immune system, even though they bear antigens that make them different from the body’s normal cells. It has been possible for some time to vaccinate the body against viruses that are associated with cancer—for example, HPV—and scientists are beginning to develop vaccines against cancer cells directly. Several vaccines are in development, but currently none are available in the United States. Another idea is to use immune cells, genetically engineered to bear the tumor’s antigens (<a href="ch20_reader_4.xhtml#data-uuid-16b61028ef9d45d9b6b771dda46b44f2" class="link-inline">Fig. 20.12</a>). When these cells are returned to the body, they produce cytokines. Recall that cytokines are chemical messengers for immune cells (see <a href="../chapter07/ch07_reader_0.xhtml" class="link-inline">Chapter 7</a>). Cytokines stimulate the body’s immune cells to attack the tumor. Further, the altered immune cells present the tumor antigen to cytotoxic T cells, which then go forth and destroy tumor cells in the body.</p>

Monoclonal antibodies have the same structure, because they are produced by the same plasma cell (see <a href="../chapter07/ch07_reader_5.xhtml#data-uuid-17aa92b4228248dd8885fa1761445b6a" class="link-inline">Fig. 7.17</a>). Some monoclonal antibodies are designed to zero in on the receptor proteins of cancer cells. To increase the killing power of monoclonal antibodies, they are linked to radioactive isotopes or chemotherapeutic drugs. It is expected that soon they will be used as initial therapies, in addition to chemotherapy.</p>

And the <i>p53</i> gene seems to trigger cell death only in cancer cells—elevating the <i>p53</i> level in a normal cell doesn’t do any harm, possibly because apoptosis requires extensive DNA damage.</p>

Now, the adenovirus can infect and kill only cells that lack a <i>p53</i> gene. Which cells are those? Tumor cells, of course. Another plus to this procedure is that the injected adenovirus spreads through the cancer, killing tumor cells as it goes. This genetically engineered virus is now in clinical trials.</p>

Among them, drugs that inhibit angiogenesis are a proposed therapy under investigation. Antiangiogenic drugs confine and reduce tumors by breaking up the network of new capillaries in the vicinity of a tumor. A number of antiangiogenic compounds are currently being tested in clinical trials. Two highly effective drugs, called angiostatin and endostatin, have been shown to inhibit angiogenesis in laboratory animals and are expected to do the same in humans.</p>

Unfortunately, growing human cells has historically been very difficult. While these cells can be coaxed to reproduce using a technique called tissue culture, they typically all die very rapidly, usually after dividing only a few times. However, metastatic cells (a form of cancer cells) can survive and thrive in tissue culture. The techniques used to grow human cells successfully in tissue culture are part of the legacy of Henrietta Lacks (<a href="ch20_reader_4.xhtml#data-uuid-91034de2bcf6441ba824db3d58c687b9" class="link-inline">Fig. 20D</a>).

In February of 1951, she experienced unexplained vaginal bleeding and sought help from a Baltimore hospital. Physicians found a quarter-sized tumor on Henrietta’s cervix. Samples of the tumor were quickly obtained, then sent to the tissue culture laboratories at Johns Hopkins University. Though radiation treatment was attempted, the tumor ravaged Henrietta’s body, appearing on all her major organs within months. After 8 months of suffering, she died in October 1951. She was survived by her husband and five children, three of whom were still in diapers.</p>

The couple had been trying to culture human cells, with little success, for more than two decades.

Infantile paralysis, or polio, occurred in epidemics that damaged the brain and spinal cord in a small percentage of patients. Paralysis of major muscle groups resulted. If the diaphragm and other respiratory muscles were affected, the disease could be fatal. For the first time, the virus could be grown in human cells—HeLa cells—so that its characteristics could be studied. The results of these studies enabled Dr. Jonas Salk to develop a vaccine for polio. Today, polio is almost unheard of in the Western world.</p>

For over 50 years, these durable cells have been used worldwide to study many types of viruses, as well as leukemia and other cancers. The cells are human in origin, so they have also been the test subjects to determine the harmful effects caused by drugs or radiation. Effective testing was developed for chromosome abnormalities and hereditary diseases using HeLa. Samples of HeLa cells have even been launched in the space shuttle for experiments involving a zero-gravity environment. HeLa cell colonies can be found around the world. The cells can even be purchased from biological supply companies.</p>

In 1974, researchers discovered that HeLa cells, like bacteria, can be transmitted through the air, on a researcher’s glove, or on contaminated glassware. This discovery led to better sterile techniques not only in the laboratory but also in operating rooms where cancerous tumors were removed.</p>

During this procedure, the surgeon removes the entire kidney. Typically, nephroblastoma does not occur in both kidneys, and because the MRI and CT scan did not indicate any problems with Cody’s other kidney, it most likely did not have the nephroblastoma. Because a single kidney is all that is needed to maintain blood homeostasis and water-salt balance in the body, Cody did not need a transplant. Initially, the chemotherapy treatment caused Cody to lose his hair, and his appetite decreased, but the doctors informed the concerned parents that this was normal, and very soon Cody would be back to his normal self.</p>

One of these is <i>WT1</i>, a gene that plays a major role in the differentiation of renal (kidney) tissue and the development of the kidneys. In Cody’s case, he probably inherited one copy of a defective gene from one of his parents. Sometime during development, the other gene in one of his kidney cells acquired a mutation that initiated the formation of the tumor. This explained why Cody’s other kidney was unaffected. Because <i>WT1</i> is active early in development, it was unlikely that Cody would have any additional complications from his cancer.</p>
