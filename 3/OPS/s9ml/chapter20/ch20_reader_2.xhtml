Scientists named this gene <i>BRCA1</i> (<i>br</i>east <i>ca</i>ncer <i>1</i>), early onset. The gene is now called <i>br</i>east <i>ca</i>ncer susceptibility gene <i>1.</i> Later, they found that breast cancer can also be due to a breast cancer gene they called<i> BRCA2.</i> These genes are tumor suppressor genes that follow a recessive pattern of inheritance (see <a href="../chapter21/ch21_reader_3.xhtml#data-uuid-acdd38cca61f4ae3af78f63eda57eb95" class="link-inline">section 21.3</a>). We inherit two copies of every gene, one from each parent. If a mutated copy of <i>BRCA1</i> or<i> BRCA2</i> is inherited from either parent, a mutation in the other copy is required before predisposition to cancer is increased. Each cell in the body already has the single mutated copy, but cancer develops wherever the second mutation occurs. If the second mutation occurs in the breast, breast cancer may develop. Ovarian cancer may develop if a second cancer-causing mutation occurs in an ovary.</p>

It takes its name from its association with retinoblastoma, a rare eye cancer that occurs almost exclusively in early childhood. In an affected child, a single mutated copy of the <i>RB</i> gene is inherited. A second mutation, this time to the other copy of the <i>RB</i> gene, causes the cancer to develop (<a href="ch20_reader_2.xhtml#data-uuid-571eb9d0ad7d4040a5367cb95888329b" class="link-inline">Fig. 20.6</a>). Retinoblastoma affecting a single eye is treated by removal of the eye, because total removal is more likely to result in a cure. Radiation, laser, and chemotherapy are options when both eyes are involved, but these treatments are less likely to produce a cure.</p>

From an evolutionary perspective, they are closely related to the retroviruses. Also known as “jumping genes,” transposons are known to cause mutation as they move throughout the genome. Although the chances of a transposon disrupting the activity of a proto-oncogene or a tumor suppressor gene in a specific cell are very small (our genome has over 3.4 billion nucleotides), there have been cases when a transposon has caused a loss of cell cycle control and been a factor in the development of cancer. Transposon activity has also been associated with the development of other diseases, such as some forms of hemophilia and muscular dystrophy.</p>

Though not a form of ionizing radiation, ultraviolet light also causes mutations. Ultraviolet radiation in sunlight and tanning lamps is most likely responsible for the dramatic increases seen in skin cancer in the past several years. Today, at least six cases of skin cancer occur for every one case of lung cancer. Nonmelanoma skin cancers are usually curable through surgery. However, melanoma skin cancer tends to metastasize and is responsible for 1–2% of cancer deaths annually in the United States.</p>

The Environmental Protection Agency recommends that every home be tested for radon, because it is the second leading cause of lung cancer in the United States. The combination of inhaling radon gas and smoking cigarettes can be particularly dangerous. A vent pipe system and fan, which pull radon from beneath the house and vent it to the outside, are the most common tools to rid a house of radon after the house is constructed.</p>

For example, cancer deaths are elevated in the vicinity of the Chernobyl Power Station (in Ukraine), which suffered a terrible accident in 1986. The 2011 incident at the Fukushima nuclear plant (in Japan) released radiation into the atmosphere. Medical professionals are still assessing the potential cancer risks from this event. Usually, however, diagnostic X-rays account for most of our exposure to artificial sources of radiation. The benefits of these procedures can far outweigh the possible risk, but it is still wise to avoid X-ray procedures that are not medically warranted. When X-rays are necessary for therapy, nearby noncancerous tissues should be shielded carefully.</p>

The greater the number of cigarettes smoked per day and the earlier the habit starts, the more likely it is that cancer will develop.
