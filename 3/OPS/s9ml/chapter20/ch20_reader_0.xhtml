He liked to play with his toys, fought with his sister, and chased the cat around the house. However, shortly after his last birthday, Cody began to complain of stomachaches and often said that he felt sick. At first, his parents paid little attention to his condition, until they noticed that his appetite was decreasing and that he kept running low fevers without any apparent cause. One morning, Cody yelled to his mom that his pee was pink. His mother rushed into the bathroom and discovered that Cody had blood in his urine. She immediately called their pediatrician and scheduled an appointment for that afternoon.</p>
            <p id="data-uuid-7f9217b5281844d392e0690693c2beac" data-uuid="7f9217b5281844d392e0690693c2beac">At the office, the doctor performed a complete physical exam and had Cody drink a couple of glasses of water to get a urine sample. During the exam, the doctor noticed a small lump in Cody’s abdomen, just around the location of his kidney. The symptoms suggested that Cody may be having a kidney problem, so the doctor scheduled a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) test the next morning for Cody.</p>
            <p id="data-uuid-e07e7e7163584e48803b16fb71fa2810" data-uuid="e07e7e7163584e48803b16fb71fa2810">The results of the MRI indicated that Cody had a mass (tumor) on his kidney, which was a sign of nephroblastoma, or Wilms disease, a rare form of kidney cancer that affects only 500 children annually. The good news was that a follow-up computerized axial tomography (CT) scan of Cody’s abdomen did not suggest that the cancer had spread to any other organs. If this was the case, Cody’s chances of survival were greater than 92%, but he was going to have to undergo surgery to remove the kidney, followed by several weeks of chemotherapy to make sure that no cancer cells were present outside the kidney. The doctor was very optimistic that they had caught Cody’s cancer in time.</p>
