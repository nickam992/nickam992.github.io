            accessory organs—salivary glands, liver, gallbladder, pancreas; <b>2. </b>Ingestion—the
            mouth takes in food; digestion—divides food into pieces and hydrolyzes food to
            molecular nutrients; movement—food is passed along from one organ to the next
            and indigestible remains are expelled; absorption—unit molecules produced by
            digestion cross the wall of the GI tract and enter the blood for delivery to
            cells; elimination—removal of indigestible wastes through the anus; <b>3. </b>Lumen,
            mucosa, submucosa, muscularis, serosa. <b>(9.2) 1. </b>Mouth contains a hard
            and soft palate, salivary glands, and a tongue; teeth have two main divisions,
            a crown with a layer of enamel and dentin, and a root filled with dentin and
            pulp; pharynx is a hollow tube at the back of the throat, connecting the mouth
            to the esophagus and trachea; esophagus is a hollow tube connecting the pharynx
            to the stomach; <b>2. </b>Mechanical digestion—teeth chew food into pieces
            convenient for swallowing and the tongue moves food around the mouth; chemical
            digestion—salivary amylase begins the process of digesting starch; <b>3. </b>The
            soft palate moves back to close off the nasal passages and the trachea moves up
            under the epiglottis to cover the glottis; this prevents nasal obstructions and
            choking. <b>(9.3) 1. </b>The stomach stores food, initiates the digestion of
            protein, and controls the movement of chyme into the small intestine; the
            mucosa has millions of gastric pits, which lead into gastric glands that
            produce gastric juice; the muscularis contains an oblique layer that allows the
            stomach to stretch and mechanically break food down; <b>2. </b>The small
            intestine completes digestion using enzymes that digest all types of food and
            absorb the products of the digestive process; its wall contains villi that have
            an outer layer of columnar epithelial cells, each containing thousands of
            microvilli; <b>3. </b>Nutrients are not absorbed through the stomach lining
            because the acidity of the gastric juices (which are neutralized in the small
            intestine) would continuously lower the blood pH; the wall of the small
            intestine has microvilli to increase surface area for absorption. <b>(9.4) 1. </b>Pancreas—
            secretes pancreatic juice containing enzymes and buffers into the small
            intestine, and hormones such as insulin into the blood; liver—filters the blood,
            removes toxic substances, stores iron and vitamins, functions in sugar
            homeostasis, regulates blood cholesterol; gallbladder—stores bile; <b>2. </b>A
            non-functioning pancreas would not make pancreatic juices to aid in digestion, nor insulin; a non-functioning liver would not produce bile to emulsify fats; if
            the gallbladder was not functioning, bile would not be stored and released
            properly; <b>3. </b>Regulation of digestive secretions is important to have the
            correct product at the correct time to digest the correct nutrient or chemical.
            Without these, the process of digestion could not occur properly and nutrients
            would not get into our circulatory system and into our cells. <b>(9.5)
            1. </b>Cecum and colon—absorb water and vitamins; rectum—form feces; anal
            canal—defecation; <b>2. </b>Large intestine contributes to homeostasis by
            regulating fluid balance and removing indigestible waste; if too much water is
            removed the feces become dry and elimination is difficult. <b>3. </b>Without
            the functions of the large intestine, water and vitamin absorption would be
            deficient. During prolonged diarrhea, dehydration leads to imbalance of salts
            which can lead to disrupted muscle contraction. <b>(9.6) 1. </b>Carbohydrates
            are simple or complex sugar units used as energy sources. They include products
            made from refined grains, beans, peas, nuts, fruits, and whole grain products;
            proteins are long chains of amino acids the body breaks down to make other
            proteins. They are found in meat, eggs, and milk; lipids are cholesterol or fats
            and oils that contain either saturated or unsaturated fatty acid chains used
            for energy storage. Olive oil contains high levels of monounsaturated fat;
            minerals are elements needed either in larger quantities (calcium, phosphorus)
            or trace quantities (zinc, iron); vitamins are other organic compounds the body
            cannot synthesize, like vitamins A,D,E, and K; <b>2. </b>Carbohydrates and fats
            contain much energy, they are consumed in excess, and with a sedentary
            lifestyle are not burned off with  exercise but instead stored; <b>3. </b>A

            tree—passage of air to the lungs; lungs— site of gas exchange between air in
            the alveoli and blood in the capillaries; <b>2. </b>Alveoli are composed of
            alveolar sacs surrounded by blood capillaries used for gas exchange; <b>3. </b>Proper
            gas exchange would not happen. Cells would not receive oxygen or be able to get
            rid of carbon dioxide, and aerobic respiration would cease. <b>(10.4) 1. </b>As
            the volume (size) of the thoracic cavity increases, the pressure in the lungs
            decreases and you inhale; as the volume decreases, the pressure in the lungs increases and you
            exhale; <b>2. </b>Tidal volume is achieved through normal breathing; vital
            capacity is the maximum volume that can be moved in and out through deep
            breathing; inspiratory and expiratory reserve volume is achieved through forced
            breathing; residual volume is the air
            that remains in the lungs after deep exhalation; <b>3. </b>The body would not
            be able to get rid of excess carbon dioxide, which would affect pH of the
            blood, energy metabolism, and other important functions. <b>(10.5) 1. </b>As the ventilation rate falls, carbon dioxide
            levels rise, causing the blood pH to lower.<b>2. </b>The rhythm of
            ventilation is controlled by a respiratory control center located in the medulla
            oblongata, which automatically sends out nerve signals to the diaphragm and the
            external intercostal muscles of the rib cage, causing inspiration. When signals
            are no longer sent, the muscles relax and expiration occurs; <b>3. </b>As you
            hold your breath, blood CO<sub>2</sub> increases, which makes the blood more acidic,
            stimulating the respiratory center to override voluntary inhibition of
            breathing. <b>(10.6) 1. </b>External respiration refers to the exchange of
            gases between air in the alveoli and blood in the pulmonary capillaries;
            internal respiration refers to the exchange of gases between the blood in
            systemic capillaries and the tissue fluid; <b>2. </b>In the lungs, Hb takes up
            oxygen and becomes oxyhemoglobin; in the tissues, Hb takes up carbon dioxide and
            becomes carbaminohemoglobin; <b>3. </b>Oxygen diffuses  out of the blood into the tissues because the
            PO<sub>2</sub>  of the tissues is lower
            than that of the blood; in the lungs, the opposite is true, so oxygen moves
            from the air in alveoli into the blood. <b>(10.7) 1. </b>Common URT disorders
