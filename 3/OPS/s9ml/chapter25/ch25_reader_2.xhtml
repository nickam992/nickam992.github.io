A resource is anything from the biotic or abiotic environment that helps meet those needs. Land, water, food, energy, and minerals are the maximally used resources that will be discussed in this chapter (<a href="ch25_reader_2.xhtml#data-uuid-33626b1f6e7f458289d0fcb3a8c58706" class="link-inline">Fig. 25.3</a>). The total amount of resources used by an individual to meet his or her needs is sometimes referred to as an ecological footprint. A person can make his or her ecological footprint smaller by driving an energy-efficient car, living in a smaller house, owning fewer possessions, eating vegetables as opposed to meat, and so forth.</p>

The effect of humans on the environment is proportional to the population size and consumption levels. As the population grows, so does the need for resources and the amount of pollution caused by using these resources. Seven people adding waste to the ocean may not be alarming, but 7 billion people doing so would certainly affect its cleanliness. In modern times, the consumption of mineral and energy resources has grown faster than population size.</p>

Living right on the coast is an unfortunate choice, because it leads to beach erosion. Loss of habitat for marine organisms and loss of a buffer zone for storms also occur. <a href="ch25_reader_2.xhtml#data-uuid-eac86e274ca548548b61c91193c83185" class="link-inline">Figure 25.4</a> shows how severe the problem can be in the United States. Coastal wetlands are also impacted when people fill them in. One reason to protect coastal wetlands is that they are spawning areas for fish and other forms of marine life. They are also habitats for certain terrestrial species, including many types of birds. Wetlands also protect coastal areas from storms. The level of storm damage to New Orleans during Hurricanes Katrina (2005) and Isaac (2012) is largely attributed to the lack of protective wetlands along the coast. Wetlands are also particularly subject to pollution, because toxic substances placed in freshwater lakes, rivers, and streams may eventually find their way to these areas.</p>

The soil can no longer hold rainwater, and it runs off instead of keeping the remaining plants alive or replenishing wells. Humans then remove whatever vegetation they can find to use as fuel or fodder for their animals. The result is a lifeless desert. That area is then abandoned as people move on to continue the process someplace else. Some ecologists estimate that nearly three-quarters of all rangelands worldwide are in danger of desertification. Many famines are due, at least in part, to degradation of the land to the point that it can no longer support humans and their livestock.</p>

They also give some 65 countries more than half their electricity. Damming of certain rivers has been so extensive that they no longer flow as they once did. The Yellow River in China fails to reach the sea most years. The Colorado River barely makes it to the Gulf of California. Even the Rio Grande dries up before it can merge with the Gulf of Mexico. The Nile in Egypt and the Ganges in India are also so overexploited they hardly make it to the ocean at some times of the year.</p>

The amount of water lost sometimes equals the amount made available! The salt left behind by evaporation and agricultural runoff increases salinity and can make a river’s water unusable farther downstream. Dams hold back less water with time because of sediment buildup. Sometimes a reservoir becomes so full of silt that it is no longer useful for storing water.</p>

Some solutions for expanding water supplies have been suggested. Planting drought- and salt-tolerant crops would help a lot. Using drip irrigation delivers more water to crops and increases crop yields as well (<a href="ch25_reader_2.xhtml#data-uuid-a8bc0c81d53d4fbebf247853b3812c49" class="link-inline">Fig. 25.9</a>). Although the first drip systems were developed in 1960, they’re used on less than 1% of irrigated land. Most governments subsidize irrigation so heavily that farmers have little incentive to invest in drip systems or other water-saving methods. Reusing water and adopting conservation measures could help the world’s industries cut their water demands by more than half.</p>

The discovery by activists that a type of genetically engineered corn called StarLink had inadvertently made it into the food supply triggered the recall of taco shells, tortillas, and many other corn-based foodstuffs from supermarkets. Further, the makers of StarLink were forced to buy back StarLink from farmers and to compensate food producers at an estimated cost of several hundred million dollars in late 2000.</p>

It contains a foreign gene taken from a common soil organism, <i>Bacillus thuringiensis,</i> which makes a protein that is toxic to many insect pests. About a dozen Bt varieties, including corn, potato, and even tomato, have now been approved for human consumption. These strains contain a gene for an insecticidal protein called CryIA. Instead, StarLink contained a gene for a related protein called Cry9C, which researchers thought might slow down the chances of pest resistance to Bt corn. In order to get FDA approval for use in foods, the makers of StarLink performed the required tests. Like the other now-approved strains, StarLink wasn’t poisonous to rodents, and its biochemical structure is not similar to those of most chemicals in food that commonly cause allergic reactions in humans (called allergens). But the Cry9C protein resisted digestion longer than the other Bt proteins when it was put in simulated stomach acid and subjected to heat. Because most food allergens resist digestion in a similar fashion, StarLink was not approved for human consumption.</p>

Also, it is unclear how resistant to digestion a protein must be in order to be an allergen, and it is also unclear what degree of amino acid sequence similarity a potential allergen must have to a known allergen to raise concern. Dean D. Metcalfe, chief of the Laboratory of Allergic Diseases at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said, “We need to understand thresholds for sensitization to food allergens and thresholds for elicitation of a reaction with food allergens.”</p>

They feel that many more studies are needed before stating for certain that Bt corn has no ecological drawbacks.</p>

Today, almost 90% of soybean acreage and 96% of cotton acreage is genetically modified. Some groups advocate that GMOs should be labeled as such, but this may not be easy to accomplish—for example, most cornmeal is derived from both conventional and genetically engineered corn. So far, there has been no attempt to sort out one type of food product from the other. However, at many health food stores, foods that do not contain GMOs are now labeled.</p>

Given its nutritional potential, should golden rice be planted and distributed on a wide scale? What information would you need to make your decision?</p>

In the LDCs, kwashiorkor, a disease caused by a severe protein deficiency, is seen in infants and children ages 1 to 3 years old. It usually occurs after a new arrival in the family and the older children are no longer fed milk. The diet then consists of protein-poor starches. Such children are lethargic and irritable and have bloated abdomens. Problems associated with intellectual development may also occur.</p>

Almost two-thirds of United States cropland is devoted to producing livestock feed. This means that a large percentage of the fossil fuel, fertilizer, water, herbicides, and pesticides used are for the purpose of raising livestock. Typically, cattle are range-fed for about 4 months. Then they are taken to crowded feedlots, where they may receive growth hormone and antibiotics. At the feedlots, they feed on grain or corn. Many animals, including cows (<a href="ch25_reader_2.xhtml#data-uuid-bf529f8dfa844b25886bae5da5312435" class="link-inline">Fig. 25.11</a>) and pigs, spend their entire lives in crowded pens and cages.</p>

Fossil fuel energy is needed not just to produce herbicides and pesticides and to grow food but also to grow feed for livestock. Raising livestock is extremely energy-intensive. In addition, water is used to wash livestock wastes into nearby bodies of water, where it adds significantly to water pollution.

As a rule of thumb, for every 10 calories of energy from a plant, only 1 calorie is available for the production of animal tissue in an herbivore. A great deal of energy is wasted when the human diet contains more protein than is needed to maintain good health. It is possible to feed ten times as many people on grain as on meat.</p>

Both of these are finite, nonrenewable sources. It was once predicted that the nuclear power industry would fulfill a significant portion of the world’s energy needs. However, this has not happened for two reasons. One is that people are very concerned about nuclear power dangers, such as the meltdown at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Russia in 1986. Further, radioactive wastes from nuclear power plants remain a threat to the environment for thousands of years. We still have not decided how best to store them safely.</p>

Thus, despite the fact that coal is plentiful in the United States, imported oil is our preferred fossil fuel. Regardless of which fossil fuel is used, all contribute to environmental problems because of the pollutants released when they’re burned.

Therefore, they become more concentrated as they pass from organism to organism along a food chain (see the Science feature, “Biomagnification of Mercury” in <a href="../chapter24/ch24_reader_1.xhtml#data-uuid-a64f8cf09c9a441491982989d38e03aa" class="link-inline">section 24.1</a>). Biological magnification is more apt to occur in aquatic food chains, which have more links than terrestrial food chains. Rachel Carson’s book <i>Silent Spring,</i> published in 1962, made the public aware of the harmful effects of pesticides, such as DDT. These substances accumulate in the mud of deltas and estuaries of highly polluted rivers and cause environmental problems if disturbed. After working their way up the food chain, high concentrations of DDT in predatory birds such as bald eagles and pelicans interfered with their ability to reproduce (<a href="ch25_reader_2.xhtml#data-uuid-666f671c40614298b13aa20e6c7aadda" class="link-inline">Fig. 25.14</a>). There are health advisories about eating certain types of fish due to the high levels of mercury they contain. Humans are often the final consumers in a variety of food chains and are affected by biological magnification as well. The breast milk of humans has been found to contain significant levels of DDT, PCBs, solvents, and heavy metals.</p>

Because of this methyl group, methylmercury easily accumulates in the food chain by biological magnification or the concentration of chemicals. Methylmercury is released into the environment by the burning of coal, the mining of certain metals, and the incineration of medical waste. Methylmercury is a powerful neurotoxin that also inhibits the activity of the immune system. Because of this, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recommend that pregnant women and small children not eat shark, swordfish, tilefish, or king mackerel and limit their consumption of albacore tuna to less than 6 ounces per week. Most states have also posted warnings on eating local fish that have been caught from mercury-contaminated waters.

As the oxygen level decreases, the diversity of life is greatly reduced. Also, human feces can contain pathogenic microorganisms that cause cholera, typhoid fever, and dysentery. In regions of the LDCs where sewage treatment is practically nonexistent, many children die each year from these diseases. Typically, sewage treatment plants use bacteria to break down organic matter to inorganic nutrients, such as nitrates and phosphates, which then enter surface waters. The result can be cultural eutrophication (see <a href="../chapter24/ch24_reader_0.xhtml" class="link-inline">Chapter 24</a>).</p>
