For death rates, South Africa had the highest rate (17.49 deaths per 1,000 people) and Qatar had one of the lowest (1.53 deaths per 1,000). For overall annual growth rates, the fastest-growing country is projected to be Lebanon (9.37%). Several countries are expected to experience declines, including Bulgaria (–0.83%) and Estonia (–0.68%). In comparison, in the United States, the projected fertility rate is 2.01 births per woman, the death rate 8.15 per 1,000 people, and the annual growth rate 0.77%.</p>

The more-developed countries (MDCs), typified by countries in North America and Europe, are those in which population growth is modest. The people in these countries enjoy a good standard of living. The less-developed countries (LDCs), typified by some countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, are those in which population growth is dramatic. The majority of people in these countries live in poverty. Many countries are in a transitional stage between being an LDC and being an MDC. Population growth is decreasing and standard of living is on the rise.</p>

Between 1850 and 1950, they doubled their populations. This was largely because of a decline in the death rate due to development of modern medicine and improvements in public health and socioeconomic conditions. The decline in the death rate was followed shortly thereafter by a decline in the birthrate. As a result, the MDCs have experienced only modest growth since 1950 (<a href="ch25_reader_1.xhtml#data-uuid-573fc55138c443e99f756cac49aff5dc" class="link-inline">Fig. 25.1</a>).</p>

In some countries, the population is not increasing but, rather, decreasing. The MDCs are expected to increase by 52 million between 2002 and 2050, but this amount will still keep their total population at just about 1.2 billion. In contrast to the other MDCs, growth in the United States has not leveled off. The U.S. population is now greater than 322 million and continues to increase. Though the birthrate in the United States has increased slightly, much of the continued population growth is due to immigration.</p>

However, the birthrate remained high. The growth rate of the LDCs peaked at 2.5% between 1960 and 1965. Since that time, the collective growth rate for the LDCs has declined. However, the growth rate has not declined in all LDCs. In many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, women give birth to more than five children each.</p>
        <p id="data-uuid-b8a4ec8d5ce347b693edeb52fdcf4f47" data-uuid="b8a4ec8d5ce347b693edeb52fdcf4f47">Between 2002 and 2050, the population of the LDCs may jump from 5 billion to at least 8 billion. Some of this increase will occur in Africa, but most will occur in Asia. Many deaths from AIDS are slowing the growth of the African population. Continued growth in Asia is expected to cause acute water scarcity, a significant loss of biodiversity, and more urban pollution. Twelve of the world’s 15 most polluted cities are in Asia.</p>
