However, we also need to consider that the excessive resource consumption of the MDCs also stresses the environment. Sustainability is incompatible with the current level of consumption of resources and the level of waste produced by the MDCs. Population growth in the LDCs and overconsumption by the MDCs account for many of the problems we are facing today (<a href="ch25_reader_4.xhtml#data-uuid-c83d37a87b2a42b793c387678177d7d2" class="link-inline">Fig. 25.18</a>).</p>

Agriculture uses large inputs of fossil fuels, fertilizer, and pesticides, which create a large amount of pollution. More freshwater is used for agriculture than in homes. Almost half the agricultural yield in the United States goes toward feeding animals. According to the ten-to-one rule of thumb, it takes 10 lb of grain to grow 1 lb of meat. Therefore, it is environmentally unsustainable for citizens in MDCs to eat as much meat as they do.</p>
        <p id="data-uuid-d9e5a09936744beebdb875bd6d0bf9b2" data-uuid="d9e5a09936744beebdb875bd6d0bf9b2">Farm animals and crops require freshwater from surface water and groundwater, and so do humans. Available supplies are dwindling, and the remaining groundwater is in danger of being contaminated. Sewage and animal wastes wash into bodies of surface water and cause overenrichment, which robs aquatic animals of the oxygen they need to survive.</p>
        <p id="data-uuid-4d3418a56d45443e9859f720331e0c8e" data-uuid="4d3418a56d45443e9859f720331e0c8e">Our society primarily uses nonrenewable fossil fuel energy, which leads to climate change, acid deposition, and smog, resulting in weakened ecosystems. The demand for goods has increased to the point that facilities to meet the demand are strained. Construction of improved infrastructure to support increased transportation needs only increases the use of nonrenewable energy resources. LDCs have increased needs for energy, making it imperative for the MDCs to develop renewable energy sources.</p>

A natural ecosystem makes use of only renewable solar energy. Its materials cycle through the various populations back to the producer once again. For example, coral reefs have been sustaining themselves for millions of years. At the same time, the reefs have provided sustenance to the LDCs. The value of coral reefs has been assessed at over $300 billion a year. Their aesthetic value is immeasurable.</p>
        <p id="data-uuid-2f2bb0482b0042a186b3429e120b40b4" data-uuid="2f2bb0482b0042a186b3429e120b40b4">It is clear that if we want to develop a sustainable society, we need to use renewable energy sources and recycle materials. We should protect natural ecosystems that help sustain our modern society. At least a quarter of the coral reefs exist close to the shores of an MDC country, and the chances are good that these coral reefs will be protected. Unfortunately, other coral reefs are threatened by unsustainable practices. The good news is that reefs are remarkably regenerative and will return to their former condition if left alone for a long enough period of time. The message of today’s environmentalists is about what can be done to improve matters and use sustainable practices (<a href="ch25_reader_4.xhtml#data-uuid-5812606f305e460a9dccb48d451cab71" class="link-inline">Fig. 25.19</a>).

Efficiency is the key to sustainability. For example, an efficient car would be ultralight and fuel efficient. Efficient cars could be just as durable and speedy as the inefficient ones of today. Only through efficiency and conservation can we meet the challenges of limited resources and finances in the future.</p>

Achieving sustainability requires that we understand how the two regions are interconnected. It would be impossible to have one sustainable but not the other, because the two regions are linked. What happens in one ultimately affects the other. Let’s consider, therefore, the importance of both rural and urban sustainability.</p>

We need to preserve both terrestrial ecosystems (such as forests and prairies) and aquatic ecosystems (freshwater and brackish ones along the coast). We should also preserve agricultural lands and other areas that provide us with renewable resources.</p>

Native grasses stabilize the soil, rebuild soil nutrients, and can serve as a source of renewable biofuel. Native trees can be planted to break the wind, protect the soil from erosion, and provide consumable products. Creative solutions to today’s ecological problems are very much needed.</p>

        <p id="data-uuid-2dbbc82f13b342a78ce0edcd0f2d6e16" data-uuid="2dbbc82f13b342a78ce0edcd0f2d6e16">The gross national product (GNP) is a measure of the flow of money from consumers to businesses in the form of goods and services purchased. It can also be considered the total costs of all manufacturing, production, and services. Costs include salaries and wages, mortgage and rent, interest and loans, taxes, and profit within and outside the country. In other words, GNP pertains solely to economic activities.</p>
        <p id="data-uuid-0bf27422f62d466f8c059571c70c16b9" data-uuid="0bf27422f62d466f8c059571c70c16b9">When calculating GNP, economists do not necessarily consider whether an activity is environmentally or socially harmful. For example, destruction of forests due to clear-cutting, strip mining, or land development is not a part of the GNP. In the same way, the cost of medical services does not include the pain or suffering caused by illness, for example.</p>
        <p id="data-uuid-a77cd47fd49049d4adb79b67e9764464" data-uuid="a77cd47fd49049d4adb79b67e9764464">Measures that include noneconomic indicators are most likely better at revealing our quality of life than is the GNP. The index of sustainable economic welfare (ISEW) includes real per capita income, distributional equity, natural resources depletion, environmental damage, and the value of unpaid labor. The ISEW <i>does</i> take into account other forms of value, beyond the purely monetary value of goods and services. Another such index is called the genuine progress indicator (GPI). This indicator attempts to consider quality of life, an attribute that does not necessarily depend on worldly goods. For example, the quality of life might depend on how much respect we give other humans. The Grameen Bank in Bangladesh decided that if women were loaned small amounts of money, they would pay it back after starting up small businesses. The loans give women the opportunity to make choices that can improve the quality of their lives. For these women, a loan is a way to sustain their lives while, in part, fulfilling their dreams. It is difficult to assign a value to well-being or happiness. However, economists are trying to devise a way to do so. The following criteria, among others, can be used.</p>

Still, we can use these values to help us direct future development. Growth creates increases in demand, but development includes the direction of growth. If we permit unbridled growth, resources will become depleted. However, if development restrains resource consumption and still promotes economic growth, perhaps a balance can be reached. We can then preserve resources for future generations.</p>

Thus, despite our knowledge of the need to protect fisheries and forests, we continue to exploit them. People in LDCs directly depend on these resources to survive and therefore have much to lose. Even so, it is difficult for them to sacrifice today for the sake of the future. There is still hope, though, because nature is incredibly resilient. One solution to deforestation is reforestation; Costa Rica has been successfully reforesting since the early 1980s. Also, declining fisheries can be restocked and then managed for sustainability. It will take an informed citizenry, creativity, and a willingness to bring about change for the better to move toward sustainability.</p>

Previously, the waste was composted and hauled to local farm fields and spread as fertilizer. This technique resulted in a variety of environmental concerns as well as a significant amount of financial loss. To help resolve the problem, Gills Onions developed an advanced energy recovery system to turn the onion waste into a methane-rich biogas that powers two fuel cells. The fuel cells in turn supply energy to the processing plant, saving an estimated $700,000 in electricity costs per year. The remaining onion waste is then sold as livestock feed, eliminating the $400,000 in expenses associated with the waste disposal. Gills Onions has become the first food-processing facility in the world to produce ultra-clean energy from its own waste and has reduced its carbon footprint by an estimated 14,500 metric tons of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per year.</p>
