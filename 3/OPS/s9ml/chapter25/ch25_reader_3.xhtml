Acid deposition weakens trees and increases their susceptibility to disease and insects, which can decimate a forest. Climate change is predicted to be the cause of habitat loss due to global temperature shifts. For example, coral reefs die off as ocean temperatures increase. Coastal wetlands may be lost as sea levels increase. The depletion of the ozone shield limits crop and tree growth and kills the plankton that sustain ocean life. Humanmade organic chemicals released into the environment may interfere with hormone function and affect the reproductive ability of various species.</p>

Rustlers dig up rare cacti, such as the single-crested saguaro, and sell them to gardeners. Parakeets and macaws are among the birds taken from the wild for sale to pet owners. Many birds die during collection and transportation for every bird delivered alive. The same holds true for tropical fish, which often come from the coral reefs of Indonesia and the Philippines. Divers dynamite reefs or use plastic squeeze bottles of cyanide to stun them. In the process, many fish die.</p>

A single Siberian tiger is now worth more than $500,000 because of its rarity. Its bones are pulverized and used as a medicinal powder. The horns of rhinoceroses become ornate carved daggers, and their bones are ground up to sell as a medicine. The ivory of an elephant’s tusk is used to make art objects, jewelry, and piano keys. The fur of a Bengal tiger sells for as much as $100,000 in Tokyo.</p>

Tuna and similar fish are captured by purse seining. A very large net surrounds a school of fish, and then the net is closed in the same manner as a drawstring purse. Dolphins that accompany the tuna are killed by this type of net. Other fishing boats drag huge trawling nets, large enough to accommodate 12 jumbo jets, along the seafloor to capture bottom-dwelling fish. Trawling has been called the marine equivalent of clear-cutting trees, because after the net goes by, the sea bottom is devastated (<a href="ch25_reader_3.xhtml#data-uuid-c0b12b37e646484cb0ae5964fe41d546" class="link-inline">Fig. 25.16<i>c</i></a>). Only large fish are kept; undesirable small fish and sea turtles are discarded, dying, back into the ocean. Cod and haddock were once the most abundant bottom-dwelling fish along the Northeast Coast. Now, they are often outnumbered by dogfish and skate.</p>

You may want to consider whether it’s a sustainable species, one that’s being overfished, or one that contains high levels of mercury. Pacific halibut is a wild fish that is a good choice. The Pacific halibut is usually caught with bottom longlines, rather than trawling nets. This fishing technique won’t damage the surrounding environment or catch unwanted fish or animals. Tilapia that is farm grown in the United States is another good choice. It’s grown in closed inland systems that prevent exposure of the fish to pollutants. But avoid tilapia from Chile or Taiwan—fish there are raised in open systems where pollutants, especially mercury, can affect the fish. You might also want to consider the levels of healthy omega-3 fatty acids in the fish you eat. Farm-raised salmon or trout supplies high concentrations of omega-3 acids (thought to protect against heart disease) and contains little or no mercury or other pollutants.</p>

When sea otters began to decline in numbers, investigators found that they were being eaten by orcas (killer whales). Usually, orcas prefer seals and sea lions to sea otters, but they began eating sea otters when seals and sea lions could not be found. The decline in seal and sea lion populations was due to the decline in the perch and herring populations as a result of overfishing. Ordinarily, sea otters keep the population of sea urchins, which feed on kelp, under control. But with fewer sea otters around, the sea urchin population exploded and decimated the kelp beds. Thus, overfishing set in motion a chain of events that detrimentally altered the food web of an ecosystem.</p>

Wildlife is exposed to domestic animals and their pathogens due to the encroachment of humans on wildlife habitats. Wildlife can also be infected by animals not ordinarily encountered. For example, African elephants carry a strain of herpes virus that is fatal to Asian elephants. Asian elephants can die if the two types of elephants are housed together.</p>

Just as human health is threatened, so is that of wildlife. Extinctions due to disease may occur.</p>

The rosy periwinkle from Madagascar is a tropical plant that has provided us with useful medicines. Potent chemicals from this plant are now used to treat leukemia and Hodgkin disease. The survival rate for childhood leukemia has gone from 10% to 90%, and Hodgkin disease is usually curable because of these drugs. Although the value of saving a life cannot be calculated, it is still sometimes easier for us to appreciate the worth of a resource if it is explained in monetary terms. Based on past success, it has been estimated that more than 300 types of drugs may yet be found in tropical rain forests. The value of this resource could be in excess of $140 billion.</p>

The same high-yield, genetically similar strains tend to be grown worldwide. At one time, rice crops in Africa were being devastated by a virus. Researchers grew wild rice plants from thousands of seed samples until they found one that contained a gene for resistance to the virus. These wild plants were then used in a breeding program to transfer the gene into high-yield rice plants. If this variety of wild rice had become extinct before being discovered, rice cultivation in Africa could have collapsed.</p>

When a rice pest, called the brown planthopper, became resistant to pesticides, farmers began to use natural brown planthopper enemies instead. The economic savings were calculated at well over $1 billion. Similarly, cotton growers in Cañete Valley, Peru, found that the cotton aphid was resistant to the pesticides being used. Research identified natural predators that are now being used to an ever greater degree by cotton farmers. Again, savings have been enormous.</p>

The honeybee, <i>Apis mellifera,</i> has been domesticated and now pollinates almost $10 billion worth of food crops annually in the United States. The value of wild bee pollinators to the U.S. agricultural economy has been calculated at $4.1 to $6.7 billion a year. And yet, modern agriculture often kills wild bees by spraying fields with pesticides.</p>

Mites—animals similar to ticks—have always been a danger for bees. Varroa mites and tracheal mites were early causes of colony stress and bee deaths (<a href="ch25_reader_3.xhtml#data-uuid-a50a5f2393fa45aaa88abd169348e708" class="link-inline">Fig. 25B</a>). However, beekeepers were very alarmed in 2006 when entire colonies of bees began to vanish. Researchers started referring to the phenomenon as colony collapse disorder (CCD). There doesn’t appear to be one factor that causes seemingly healthy bees to vanish from their hives. Scientists now believe that multiple factors may stress bees, causing them to be vulnerable to infection by a parasite or pathogen. The indiscriminate use of pesticides (specifically, neonicotinoids), the strain of being moved from place to place to pollinate crops, and/or poor nutrition (because genetically engineered plants don’t provide as much food for the bees) may contribute to CCD.</p>

Ideally, a cause-and-effect treatment for CCD will be found soon, thanks to worldwide research dedicated to solving the problem, as well as improved funding from agricultural agencies. Until then, there are things you can do to keep bees in your area healthy. Research and then plant native plants in your yard and garden. These typically require less fertilizer and water than other plants, and they will provide more pollen and nectar for the bees. In the southern and midwestern regions of the United States, bees enjoy red clover, foxglove, bee balm, and joe-pye weed. Desert willow and manzanita will attract desert bees. Choose palms for tropical areas. In addition, native plants that flower at different times of the year will provide a constant food source. Midday is typically when bees are out foraging, so if you have to use pesticides, apply them late in the day. Plants that rely on the honeybees for pollination—as well as your body—will thank you!</p>

The water cycle continually supplies freshwater to terrestrial ecosystems. Humans use freshwater in innumerable ways, including drinking and irrigation of crops. Freshwater ecosystems, such as rivers and lakes, also provide us with fish and other types of organisms for food.</p>
        <p id="data-uuid-27c473cbb862498eb5236e8a161b159e" data-uuid="27c473cbb862498eb5236e8a161b159e">Unlike other commodities, there is no substitute for freshwater. We can remove salt from seawater to obtain freshwater. However, the cost of desalination is about four to eight times the average cost of freshwater acquired via the water cycle.</p>
        <p id="data-uuid-e60719a742524e83a779e163e45efc1e" data-uuid="e60719a742524e83a779e163e45efc1e">Forests and other natural ecosystems exert a “sponge effect.” They soak up water and then release it at a regular rate. When rain falls in a natural area, plant foliage and dead leaves lessen its impact. The soil then slowly absorbs it, especially if the soil has been aerated by organisms. The water-holding capacity of forests reduces the possibility of flooding. Forests release water slowly for days or weeks after the rains have ceased. Rivers flowing through forests in West Africa release between three and five times as much water at the end of the dry season, as do rivers from coffee plantations.</p>

The importance of this ecosystem attribute is especially observed following deforestation. In Pakistan, the world’s largest dam, the Tarbela Dam, is losing its storage capacity of 12 billion cubic meters (m<sup>3</sup>) many years sooner than expected. Deforestation is causing silt to build up behind the dam, decreasing its storage capacity. At one time, the Republic of the Philippines was exporting $100 million worth of oysters, mussels, clams, and cockles each year. Now, silt carried down rivers following deforestation is smothering the mangrove ecosystem that serves as a nursery for these shellfish. Most coastal ecosystems are not as bountiful as they once were because of deforestation and a myriad of other environmental problems.</p>

The biodiversity within ecosystems contributes to the workings of the water, phosphorus, nitrogen, carbon, and other biogeochemical cycles. We depend on these cycles for freshwater, provision of phosphate, uptake of excess soil nitrogen, and removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. When human activities upset the usual workings of biogeochemical cycles, the dire environmental consequences include the release of excess pollutants that are harmful to us. Technology is unable to substitute for any of the biogeochemical cycles.</p>

In a rain forest, trees help maintain area rainfall. Forests would become arid without the trees.</p>

The leaves of trees use carbon dioxide when they photosynthesize, and the bodies of the trees store carbon. When trees are cut and burned, carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide makes a significant contribution to climate change, which is expected to be stressful for many plants and animals. Only a small percentage of wildlife may be able to move to new communities, where the weather will be suitable for them.</p>

Many tourists want to go sport fishing, whale watching, boat riding, hiking, bird watching, and the like.</p>
