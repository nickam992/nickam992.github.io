In other words, the X chromosome carries genes that affect both males and females. It would be logical to suppose that a sex-linked trait is passed from father to son or from mother to daughter, but this is not the case. A male always receives an X-linked allele from his mother, from whom he inherited an X chromosome. <i>The Y chromosome from the father does not carry an allele for the trait.</i> Usually, a sex-linked genetic disorder is recessive. Therefore, a female must receive two alleles, one from each parent, before she has the disorder.</p>

Some forms of color blindness (red-green) are X-linked.  There is no treatment for color blindness, but the disorder itself does not lead to a significant disability for the patient. Color blindness affects about 8–12% of Caucasian males and 0.5% of Caucasian females in the United States.

Muscle weakness intensifies and respiratory and cardiovascular conditions progress until the individual is confined to a wheelchair, normally by ages 7 to 10. Death usually occurs by ages 20 to 25. Therefore, affected males are rarely fathers. The recessive allele remains in the population by passage from carrier mother to carrier daughter.</p>

Much investigative work determined that dystrophin is involved in the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in muscle fibers. The lack of dystrophin causes calcium to leak into the cell, which promotes the action of an enzyme that dissolves muscle fibers. When the body attempts to repair the tissue, fibrous tissue forms (<a href="ch21_reader_5.xhtml#data-uuid-a57f1d8094e444678abee90562c58f52" class="link-inline">Fig. 21.21</a>).

Fragile X syndrome affects 1 out of every 4,000 males and 1 out of every 8,000 females on average. Males with full symptoms of the condition have characteristic physical abnormalities—a long face, and prominent jaw, large ears, joint laxity (excessively flexible joints), and genital abnormalities. Other common characteristics include tactile defensiveness (dislike of being touched), poor eye contact, repetitive speech patterns, hand flapping, and distractibility. Females with the condition present with variable symptoms. Most of the same traits seen in males with fragile X syndrome have been reported in females as well, but often the symptoms are milder in females and present with lower frequency.</p>

Lack of this protein in the brain results in the various manifestations of the disease. As the name implies, a gene defect is found on the X chromosome. The genetic basis of fragile X syndrome is similar to that seen in Huntington disease (see <a href="ch21_reader_3.xhtml#data-uuid-acdd38cca61f4ae3af78f63eda57eb95" class="link-inline">section 21.3</a>). In both cases, the gene in question has too many repeated copies of a DNA sequence containing three nucleotides (called a trinucleotide repeat). In fragile X syndrome, the DNA sequence is CGG. (Recall that in Huntington disease the repeated sequence is CAG.) Fewer than 59 copies of the repeated sequence is considered normal. Between 59 and 200 copies is considered “premutation.” Generally, both males and females with the premutation genotype have normal intellect and appearance, although they can have subtle intellectual or behavioral symptoms. Persons whose DNA has over 200 copies of the repeat have “full mutation” and show the physical and behavioral traits of fragile X syndrome.</p>

For example, a female with 100 copies of the repeat is considered to have a premutation. When this female passes her X chromosome with the premutation to her offspring, the number of repeats may expand to over 200. This would result in a full mutation in her child. In a recent study, maternal premutations of between 90 and 200 repeats resulted in an expansion to full mutation in 80–100% of the offspring.</p>

Actually, the name refers to the appearance of the chromosome under a microscope. In extreme cases of fragile X syndrome, in which there are many copies of the trinucleotide repeat, a portion of the X chromosome appears to be hanging from a thread. However, the appearance of the chromosome is not a cause of the disease. Fragile X syndrome is a result of a malfunction in the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP).</p>

There are two common types. Hemophilia A is due to the absence or minimal presence of a clotting factor known as factor VIII, and the less common hemophilia B is due to the absence of clotting factor IX. In the United States, 1 in every 5,000 males is affected with hemophilia. Of those, 80–85% specifically have the more common hemophilia A. Rarely are females affected by hemophilia, averaging 1 in every 50 million women in the United States. Hemophilia is called the bleeder’s disease, because the affected person’s blood either does not clot or clots very slowly. Although hemophiliacs bleed externally after an injury, they also bleed internally, particularly around joints. Hemorrhages can be stopped with transfusions of fresh blood (or plasma) or concentrates of the clotting protein. Also, factors VIII and IX are now available as biotechnology products.</p>

From her, the disease eventually spread to the Prussian, Spanish, and Russian royal families. In that era, monarchs arranged marriages between their children to consolidate political alliances. This practice allowed the gene for hemophilia to spread throughout the royal families. It is assumed that a spontaneous mutation arose either in Queen Victoria after her conception or in one of the gametes of her parents. However, in the book <i>Queen Victoria’s Gene</i> by D. M. Potts, the author postulates that Edward Augustus, Duke of Kent, may not have been Queen Victoria’s father. Potts suggests that Victoria may have instead been the illegitimate child of a hemophiliac male. Regardless of her parentage, had Victoria not been crowned, the fate of the various royal households may have been very different. Further, the history of Europe could have been changed dramatically as well.</p>

Queen Victoria and her husband, Prince Albert, had nine children. Fortunately, only one son, Leopold, suffered from hemophilia. He experienced severe hemorrhages and died in 1884 at the age of 31 as a result of a minor fall. He left behind a daughter, Alice, a carrier for the disease. Her son Rupert also suffered from hemophilia and in 1928 died of a brain hemorrhage as a result of a car accident. Queen Victoria’s eldest son, Edward VII, the heir to the throne, did not have the disease; thus, the current British royal family is free of the disease.</p>

Alice married Louis IV, the Grand Duke of Hesse. Of her six children, three were affected by hemophilia. Her son Frederick died of internal bleeding from a fall. Alice’s daughter Irene married Prince Henry of Prussia, her first cousin. Two of their three sons suffered from hemophilia. One of these sons, Waldemar, died at age 56 due to the lack of blood-transfusion supplies during World War I. Henry, Alice’s other son, bled to death at the age of 4.</p>

Alexandra gave birth to four daughters before giving birth to Alexei, the heir to the Russian throne. It was obvious almost from birth that Alexei had hemophilia. Every fall caused bleeding into his joints, which led to crippling of his limbs and excruciating pain. The best medical doctors could not help Alexei. Desperate to relieve his suffering, his parents turned to the monk Rasputin. Rasputin was able to relieve some of Alexei’s suffering by hypnotizing him and putting him to sleep. Alexandra and Nicholas, the czar and czarina, put unlimited trust in Rasputin. The illness of the only heir to the czar’s throne, the strain Alexei’s illness placed on the czar and czarina, and the power of Rasputin were all factors leading to the Russian Revolution of 1917. The czar and czarina, as well as their children, were all murdered during the revolution.</p>

Her son Leopold was a hemophiliac, dying at 32 during a knee operation. Beatrice’s daughter Victoria Eugenie married Alfonso XIII of Spain. Queen Ena, as Victoria Eugenie came to be known, was not popular with the Spanish people. Her firstborn son, Alfonso, the heir to the Spanish throne, did not stop bleeding on his circumcision. When it became obvious that she had given her son hemophilia, it is alleged that her husband never forgave her. Like his cousin Rupert, Alfonso died in 1938 from internal bleeding after a car accident. Victoria’s youngest son, Gonzalo, was also a hemophiliac whose life was claimed by a car accident in 1934.</p>

She drew out a pedigree chart depicting both Patrick and his parents. Patrick was affected and neither of his parents was, which meant that both of his parents were carriers of the disorder. She explained how the diagnosis of PKU was made on Patrick by use of the HPLC test and what the disorder might mean to his health and development. The characteristics of PKU—reduced brain development, seizures, and so on—can be avoided; because the problem is the buildup of phenylalanine levels, the main goal during developmental years is to eliminate or reduce the intake of phenylalanine. She explained that a diet restricting phenylalanine intake starting right away and continuing until Patrick finished puberty would result in little to no adverse effects. This diet, combined with prescribed protein supplements, would help Patrick avoid the buildup of phenylalanine in his neurons and would allow his brain to develop normally.</p>
