Many of these diseases occur as a result of changes, or mutations, in our parents’ genetic codes. The abnormal gene could be present in each of your parents’ cells and thus passed down in the sperm or egg. Your parent may or may not have been affected by this genetic mutation. Alternatively, the genetic mutation might have occurred only in the sperm or egg that became a part of you. Some genetic diseases require two damaged alleles for the disease to manifest itself. Others need only one. When a genetic disorder is autosomal dominant, an individual with the alleles <i>AA</i> or <i>Aa</i> will have the disorder. When a genetic disorder is autosomal recessive, only individuals with the alleles <i>aa</i> will have the disorder. Genetic counselors often construct pedigrees to determine whether a condition that runs in the family is dominant or recessive. A pedigree shows the pattern of inheritance for a particular condition. Consider these two possible patterns of inheritance:</p>

Without this enzyme, the buildup will interfere with proper brain development and growth and cause malfunctions in vision, movement, hearing, and overall mental development. This impairment leads to blindness, seizures, and paralysis. Currently, there is no cure for Tay-Sachs disease; affected children normally die by the age of 5 (<a href="ch21_reader_3.xhtml#data-uuid-fa7302ad75e0463687d52eab6fc2649a" class="link-inline">Fig. 21.10</a>).</p>

Many are sickle- or boomerang-shaped, and these red blood cells live for only about 2 weeks, unlike the average 4-month lifespan of a normal red blood cell. The defect is caused by an abnormal hemoglobin that differs from normal hemoglobin by one amino acid in the protein globin. The single amino acid change causes hemoglobin molecules to stack up and form insoluble rods. This causes the red blood cells to become sickle-shaped (see <a href="../chapter06/ch06_reader_2.xhtml#data-uuid-5778ffb421364751bbe66568ae310667" class="link-inline">section 6.2</a>).

This results in anemia, tissue damage, jaundice, joint pain, and gallstones. Those affected by sickle-cell disease are also susceptible to many types of bacterial infections and have a higher incidence of stroke. Many treatment options, including blood transfusions and bone marrow transplants, are highly effective. The most common medicinal treatment, hydroxyurea, has been on the market for several decades and is considered one of the most effective daily treatments for the reduction in sickle-cell-related anemia, joint pain, and tissue damage.</p>

Sickle-cell heterozygotes have sickle-cell traits in which the blood cells are normal unless they experience dehydration or mild oxygen deprivation. Intense exertion may cause sickling of some red blood cells for a short period of time. These patients can experience episodes and symptoms very similar to those of patients with the autosomal recessive genotype.</p>

Although at least nine types of the disorder are known, most are linked to mutations in two genes necessary to the synthesis of a type I collagen—one of the most abundant proteins in the human body. Collagen has many roles, including providing strength and rigidity to bone and forming the framework for most of the body’s tissues. Osteogenesis imperfecta leads to a defective collagen I that causes the bones to be brittle and weak. Because the mutant collagen can cause structural defects even when combined with normal collagen I, osteogenesis imperfecta is generally considered to be dominant.</p>

Some historians think that the Viking chieftain Ivar Ragnarsson, who was known as Ivar the Boneless and was often carried into battle on a shield, had this condition. In most cases, the diagnosis is made in young children who visit the emergency room frequently due to broken bones. Some children with the disorder have an unusual blue tint in the sclera, the white portion of the eye; reduced skin elasticity; weakened teeth; and heart valve abnormalities. The disorder is treatable with a number of drugs that help increase bone mass, but these drugs must be taken long-term.</p>

The defective gene contains segments of DNA in which the base sequence CAG repeats again and again. This type of structure, called a trinucleotide repeat, causes the huntingtin protein to have too many copies of the amino acid glutamine. The normal version of huntingtin has stretches of between 10 and 25 glutamic acids. If huntingtin has more than 36 glutamic acids, as is seen in the mutated Huntington gene, it changes shape and forms clumps inside neurons. These clumps attract other proteins to clump, rendering them inactive. One of these proteins that attaches itself to the clumps, called CBP, helps nerve cells survive.</p>

Huntington disease has a range of symptoms but is normally characterized by uncontrolled movements, unsteady gait, dementia, and speech impairment. On average, patients live 15 to 20 years after onset of symptoms, as the disease progresses rapidly. Current effective treatments include medications that slow the progression of the disease. Additionally, dopamine blockers have been found to be very effective in reducing uncontrolled movements and improving eye-hand coordination and steadiness during walking.</p>

Recall that meiosis in females results in a single egg and at least two polar bodies (see <a href="../chapter17/ch17_reader_4.xhtml#data-uuid-d261c28901e44981aa025022a0ff2d53" class="link-inline">Fig. 17.9</a>). Polar bodies later disintegrate. They receive very little cytoplasm, but they do receive a haploid number of chromosomes. When a woman is heterozygous for a recessive genetic disorder, about half of the first polar bodies have received the mutated allele. In these instances, the egg received the normal allele. Therefore, if a polar body tests positive for a recessive mutated allele, the egg received the normal dominant allele. Only normal eggs are then used for IVF. Even if the sperm should happen to carry the mutation, the zygote will, at worst, be heterozygous. But the phenotype will appear normal.</p>
